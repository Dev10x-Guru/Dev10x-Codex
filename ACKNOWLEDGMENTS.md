## Inspirations

Projects, talks, and writing that shaped the design of Dev10x skills,
hooks, and conventions:

- **QRSPI / Research-Plan-Implement** — Dexter Horthy
  ([HumanLayer](https://github.com/humanlayer)). Talk:
  "Everything We Got Wrong About Research-Plan-Implement". Inspired the
  scope skill, blind-research mode, instruction-budget audits, vertical
  slice decomposition, and 40% context-fill ceiling guidance.
- **From RPI to QRSPI** — Alex Lavaee. Article:
  <https://alexlavaee.me/blog/from-rpi-to-qrspi/>. Companion writeup
  that informed the Design Discussion artifact in the scope skill.
- **superpowers** — Jesse Vincent
  ([obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)). Inspired
  the inline-context subagent dispatch pattern and the
  brainstorming / writing-plans / receiving-code-review skill family.
- **Fowler — Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture** —
  <https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/>. Source catalog used by the
  project-audit skill for design-pattern stress tests.
- **Refactoring Guru** —
  <https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog>. Pattern reference
  used alongside PoEAA in architecture reviews.
- **Software Archetypes** — <https://www.softwarearchetypes.com/>.
  Structural alignment framework used in the architecture-advisor and
  project-audit skills.
- **gitmoji** — <https://gitmoji.dev/>. Commit prefix vocabulary used by
  git-commit and PR title conventions.
- **semantic-release** —
  <https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release>. Drives the
  gitmoji-to-release-impact auto-detection in git-commit.
- **Jobs To Be Done / Job Stories** — Alan Klement, Clayton Christensen,
  and the JTBD community. The JTBD voice (`When … I want to … so I
  can …`) is the foundation of the jtbd, ticket-jtbd, and outcome-
  focused commit/PR titles.
