"""Regression tests for the verify-acc-dod default checks (GH-736).

A skill-audit caught the work-on completion gate offering "Work complete
(Recommended)" while the "No unresolved review threads" check was failing
after the supervisor had explicitly *deferred* review threads. The honest
fix is for the ``review-deferred`` mode to skip the unresolved-threads
check (so the DoD reflects the agreed scope) — not to paper over a red
check with gate framing.

These tests pin the ``modes`` mapping on the relevant checks so the
``review-deferred`` contract cannot silently regress.

GH-1172 adds a second concern: the skill collapsed its
``friction_level``-keyed behaviour table to a single baseline. The
tests below pin what MUST survive that collapse — the merge-gated
completion matrix stays sourced from
``completion_gate_recommendation()``, and the resolver /
recommendation boundary stays documented rather than merged away.
