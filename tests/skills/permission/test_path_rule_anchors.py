"""Path-rule anchor semantics and the GH-1325 compaction proof.

Four jobs, in order of what they protect:

- unit coverage of the anchor/depth reading itself;
- an equivalence proof that ``Read|Edit(//tmp/Dev10x/**)`` reaches every
  path the retired ten-namespace enumeration was meant to reach. A
  compaction that drops coverage is invisible: nothing errors, the
  affected command simply prompts on every call forever (GH-1153);
- counter-checks in the GH-1215 shape. That ticket records a guard
  passing 3/3 while its own discovery was blind to four fifths of the
  surface, so each catalog's rule set is measured twice — by scanning
  the raw text and by walking the parsed document — and the two must
  agree;
- the retirement of ``/tmp/claude`` (GH-1395), which was dead twice
  over: misanchored, and pointing at a tree superseded by
  ``/tmp/Dev10x`` in GH-949.
