"""Every grouped baseline rule must reach the seeding path (GH-1313).

``skills/upgrade-cleanup/projects.yaml`` is the authoritative permission
catalog — it is the one on the write path. ``baseline-permissions.yaml``
carries a second, comparably-sized ``groups:`` block that ``ensure_base``
never reads, so a rule can be catalogued there, cited by skills, relied
on by hooks, and still prompt on every call. GH-1100's E18 (a ``cp`` rule
excepting a hard-deny) and E19 (``git nopager``) are that bug twice.

The guard below closes the class: a grouped rule is either seeded, or in
an opt-in group, or named in ``RULES_NOT_SEEDED`` with a reason.

The remaining tests are counter-checks, and they are the point of
GH-1215. That ticket records ``test_catalog_covers_mcp_tools``'s own
discovery narrowed to five of twelve modules — passing 3/3 while blind to
four fifths of its surface. A guard only sees what its enumeration sees,
so each side of this comparison is measured a second way:

- ``test_enumeration_finds_every_declared_rule`` counts rule lines in the
  raw YAML text and asserts the parser found at least that many, so a
  group shape the walker skips fails loudly.
- ``test_every_rule_bearing_section_is_folded`` asserts the seeded side
  reads every rule-bearing section of ``projects.yaml``, so a section
  added later cannot make unseeded rules look seeded — or unseeded ones
  unreadable.
- ``test_opt_in_groups_are_all_tier_three`` pins the exclusion to the
  catalog's own tier tags, so re-tagging a seeded group cannot quietly
  remove it from the guard's field of view.
