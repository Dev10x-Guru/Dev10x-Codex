"""GH-1314: the Stop gate has two audiences it must not address.

"A turn always ends on a widget" presumes a supervisor on the other end.
``decide`` had four exit branches before its block and none of them asked
who was listening, so two cases fell through:

  - a **subagent**, which has no supervisor at all. One was observed
    ending its report with "No open decisions on my end. Are we done
    here?" — a near-verbatim echo of this module's own no-open-work
    steer. It was not inventing a status check; it was complying with a
    block it should never have received.
  - a session the supervisor **parked**. The widget's only answers
    re-armed it next turn, so there was no way to say "stop asking until
    I speak".

Both branches are non-blocking and both carry their own ``StopSignal``,
so the guard is observable in the field rather than assumed.
