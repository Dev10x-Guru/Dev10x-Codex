"""Shared fixtures for the hook tests.

``test_stop_verdict.py`` and ``test_stop_verdict_audience.py`` both
drive :func:`dev10x.hooks.stop_verdict.decide`, so they need the same
two things: the audit attribution slot emptied around each test, and
both on-disk markers pointed somewhere other than the real
``/tmp/Dev10x``. ``test_block_attribution.py`` needs the first of
those and used to declare its own copy.

The marker fixture patches ``_standby_path`` as well as
``_marker_path`` even for tests that only exercise the cooldown. A
fixture that isolates one marker and not the other is the shape that
lets a later test leak into the developer's real ``/tmp`` without
failing — so the superset is the safer default, and the extra patch
costs a test that never touches standby nothing.

The per-file ``_transcript`` helpers stay where they are: they are
pure functions over ``tmp_path`` holding no state that can leak
between tests, which is the problem a shared fixture solves.
