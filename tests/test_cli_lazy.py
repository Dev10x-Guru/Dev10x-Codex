"""Guards for the Click LazyGroup CLI (GH-249 H10).

The lazy-loading CLI defers subcommand imports for startup speed
(see `.claude/rules/performance.md`). These tests pin the registered
subcommand set so a subcommand cannot silently fall out of the
`lazy_subcommands` map, and verify every declared import path resolves
to a real Click command.
