# Post-Upgrade Verification (GH-1137)

Run this after a local plugin upgrade's maintenance pass, before
trusting the new version.

**Read the maintenance log for what it did, not for what it
achieved.** GH-1136 is the reason this checklist exists:
`ensure-base` reported "All base permissions already covered by
global settings" while 137 of 285 catalog rules were absent from
every project file. The run was truthful and the outcome was
wrong, because the check was a reading of the log rather than of
the files. Silence was the defect. So verify against the files.

## 1. Catalog reach

Run `dev10x permission catalog-gap` for the main checkout AND
every worktree root. Each must report:

```
0 missing allow / 0 missing deny / 0 missing ask
```

Include a **freshly created** worktree as its own case: seeding a
new worktree is a separate code path (`seed_worktree`) from
seeding an existing checkout, and the two have regressed
independently.

The `ask` count is new as of GH-1154. A catalog predating the ask
tier reports `0 missing ask` trivially; a non-zero count means the
tier shipped but did not propagate.

**`0 missing ask` is therefore not self-verifying — confirm which
of the two it means.** Run:

```
dev10x permission catalog-diff --strict
```

A `shipped SECTIONS absent from userspace` block naming `base_asks`
means the zero is trivial: the tier never reached the catalog, so
there was nothing to propagate and nothing to miss. No such block
means the zero is real.

GH-1249 is why this matters. On the machine that prompted this
checklist's own first run, `catalog-gap` reported `0 missing ask`
across 76 of 77 settings files while the userspace catalog had no
`base_asks` section at all — and the same catalog had no
`tracker_permissions`, so a repo pinned `tracker: github` carried
none of its tracker rules. Every file-level check passed. Reading
the zero as "the ask tier propagated" is exactly the
truthful-log-wrong-outcome failure this document exists to prevent,
reproduced against the document itself.

The sections merge as of GH-1249, so a current plugin fixes the
underlying gap; the disambiguation stays because a `0` that means
two different things is worth resolving explicitly either way.

## 2. Nothing git-tracked was written

`git status` must be clean in every repo whose
`.claude/settings.json` is git-tracked.

A dirty tracked settings file means a writer bypassed the shared
guard (`partition_writable`, shared across every writer as of
GH-1155). **Report it rather than reverting.** GH-1155's evidence:
one maintenance run took a tracked file from 2 committed rules to
1495 allow / 51 ask / 82 deny, and 597 of those rules existed ONLY
in the tracked file — reverting it to its committed state would
have silently destroyed them and reintroduced prompts everywhere.

## 3. Safety keys intact

`disableAutoMode` and `disableBypassPermissionsMode` must still be
the **string** `"disable"` in every settings layer.

`true` is silently ignored, so a boolean here reads as protection
that is not actually in force.

Run `dev10x permission doctor safety-keys` rather than reading the
values by hand — it is read-only, checks every discovered settings
file (not only the global one, which GH-47 makes non-authoritative
on its own), and exits non-zero on any missing or invalid key. Seed
a missing key with `dev10x permission ensure-safety-keys` (GH-1320);
it only ever adds an absent key as the literal string `"disable"`
and never overwrites an existing value, so an invalid existing value
still needs a human decision.

## 4. Spot-check the shapes users actually type

Confirm that a sanctioned command does not prompt.

`pre-commit run` is the worked example. It was catalogued only in
its discouraged `uv run pre-commit run` form until GH-1149, while
the *sanctioned* direct form was absent. The user's global
settings happened to carry the direct form, which masked the gap
entirely — until GH-47 (a project `settings.local.json` wins
outright) made the global entry irrelevant to every project.

The lesson generalizes: a rule present *somewhere* is not a rule
that applies *here*. Check the form the docs tell people to use,
in a project that has its own settings file.

## Filing what you find

A gap found here belongs in its own focused issue that references
the permission-friction tracker (GH-1100) — not appended to this
checklist, and not implemented directly from the tracker. That is
exactly how GH-1149 was split out of GH-1137's own first run: the
verification passed every check except the `pre-commit` spot-check,
and the one failure became a separate, closable issue.
