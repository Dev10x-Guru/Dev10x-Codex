# Create Commit

Create properly formatted git commits with gitmoji, ticket
reference, 72-char title limit, structured body, and outcome-
focused titles (JTBD style).

## Instructions

The full workflow — 12 steps covering branch validation, ticket
extraction, commit type, description prompts, solution points,
line-length validation, staging, and commit creation — lives in
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. `AskUserQuestion` gates documented there
are REQUIRED.

**End-to-end read enforcement (GH-166):** Consume
`instructions.md` via a full `Read` of the file. Do NOT use
`Grep`, partial `Read(offset=...)`, or token-budget skimming
to locate specific steps — guardrails (e.g., the Scope
Invariant, the Pre-staging Gate, the 72-char validation, the
mktmp-only temp path) are scattered across the document, and
agents that read only the section they "need" routinely miss
them. If file size is a concern, request the entire body
once and rely on the parsed context for subsequent steps.
