# Why the crew template pins specific tool shapes

The evidence behind the verbatim lines in
[`crew-prompt-template.md`](crew-prompt-template.md) § 2 and § 5.

The template itself carries only what a worker receives word-for-word;
it is far over its size budget already, so the reasoning lives here.
Each rule below is a worker death, not a style preference — and each
failed the same way, which is the part worth internalising: **a wedged
worker leaves no trace.** A pending permission prompt is neither a
block nor a denial, so it records nothing in the hook log. The only
signal is silence, and silence is what the stall detector reads last.

## `find` → the Glob tool (GH-1059)

Two sonnet workers froze simultaneously on the same shape — a Bash
`find` over a SvelteKit route group, whose path segments carry
shell-escaped parentheses:

```
find …/routes/\(app\)/class-health/\[classId\]/print -type f
```

Both went silent for 25–35+ minutes with no heartbeat. A respawned
gen-3 worker, told "use the Glob tool, never Bash `find`", cleared the
identical step immediately.

Note what the older `find-search` validator patterns missed: they keyed
on `-name` / `-path` / `-exec`, and this command has none of them. A
plain `find <path> -type f` looked innocuous right up until the escaped
parens matched no allow rule. The patterns were widened in the same
change that added this rule.

**The diagnostic lesson generalises.** When two workers die at the same
command shape, that is a tool-layer defect, not a monitoring-cadence
problem. The corrective respawn must name the substitution; a
replacement handed the same shape wedges the same way. See
[`stall-protocol.md`](stall-protocol.md) § Structural false positives.

## `pre-commit` → whatever Phase 0.4 proved (GH-1066)

`{{lint_shape}}` is a placeholder precisely because there is no
universal answer.

The validate-bash hook denies `uv run --directory <worktree>
pre-commit …` and advises "pre-commit is installed on PATH — run
pre-commit directly". For a main session that steer is correct. For an
`Agent`-spawned subagent it is actively wrong: Bash CWD resets to the
dispatcher's directory on every call (GH-1028), so a bare `pre-commit`
resolves the git repo from the wrong worktree and lints a tree the
worker never touched — silently, and green.

The `--directory` form is now exempted from that block, because there
the `uv` wrapper is pinning CWD rather than shifting an env prefix. But
the shape still has to be proven for the night, or lint declared
CI-only, at Phase 0.4. Otherwise every run rediscovers it at 02:00 —
which is what the 2026-08-23 run did, settling on CI-only lint for the
whole night (run decision D4).

## Web build/check shapes → `run_node_tests(script=…)` (GH-1052)

`run_node_tests` was originally read as a *test* wrapper, so the crew
template named only test invocations and workers reached for the Bash
layer for everything else. But GH-1029 gave the tool a `script=`
parameter: any `package.json` script runs through it, which makes
`pnpm run build`, `pnpm run check:*`, a bare `vite`, and
`node <script>` wrapper-reachable too.

2026-08-19 night run: crew worker B2 (opus) posted the heartbeat "pnpm
deps installed; starting SvelteKit UI" at 10:11Z, then made zero tool
calls and zero file writes for 80+ minutes. The exact command is
unrecoverable — a *pending* prompt records nothing, which is the same
no-trace signature as the `find` and `pre-commit` deaths above — but
the timing puts it on a web-tooling shape immediately after deps
install. Its replacement, briefed to route ALL web tooling through
`run_node_tests(script="build" / "check:i18n" / "check:plurals")`,
delivered the chunk cleanly: 1035 vitest tests, the build, and both
i18n gates, with zero prompts.

Two shape rules the wrapper enforces, worth stating in the brief:

- Only `yarn`/`npm`/`pnpm` resolve a script name. `jest`/`vitest` are
  invoked directly through `npx` and have no script table, so pairing
  `script=` with them returns an error rather than silently ignoring it.
- `env=` is overlaid on the inherited environment, not substituted for
  it — the escape hatch for a script whose definition pins something
  the wrapper would otherwise drop, such as a `TZ` that snapshot tests
  depend on.

The `node-build-scripts` entry in `command-skill-map.yaml` carries the
same steer for sessions outside a foreman run. It is advisory, not
blocking: hard-blocking a web-tooling shape would strand an unattended
worker exactly the way the unanswered prompt did.

## CWD mode → test it, do not assume it (GH-1050)

Three plugin artifacts each asserted a different absolute rule, and
each was wrong at some spawn depth:

| Artifact | Asserted |
|----------|----------|
| crew template § 6 + `tool-surface.md` (GH-1028) | CWD resets every call — pin with `git -C` always |
| `background_preamble` (GH-959) | a standalone `cd` is allowed and CWD persists — no `git -C` |
| `validate-bash-command.py` | DENIES `git -C <path>` when CWD already equals `<path>` |

The third denies exactly what the first mandates, in exactly the
situation the second describes. 2026-08-19 night run:

- The Phase 0.4 probe subagent (spawned by the top-level session,
  depth 1): `cd` **persisted**; `git -C <own-cwd> status` ran clean.
- Crew worker B1 (spawned by the foreman subagent, depth 2): `cd` did
  **not** persist. Its own kill snippet: "The `cd` doesn't persist in
  agent threads, so I'll use the `cd X; cmd` form." That chained shape
  is hook-blocked, the prompt was unanswerable overnight, and the
  worker wedged at fetch/rebase. Cost: ~2h and two takeovers — the
  worker plus the foreman that was waiting on it.
- The watchdog itself was hook-denied
  `git -C /work/…/wt-10 status --short` after a standalone `cd` to
  that path.

So the mode is not a property of "being a subagent"; it varies, and
possibly nondeterministically. The recipe below was hot-patched into
the template mid-night, and the respawned worker — which landed in
Mode C — delivered its chunk cleanly:

1. `cd <worktree>` then `pwd`, as two separate Bash calls.
2. `pwd` == worktree → **Mode P**: plain git thereafter, never
   `git -C` (the redundancy denial fires).
3. `pwd` != worktree → **Mode C**: `git -C <worktree>` on every call.
4. Both modes: chaining (`;`, `&&`, pipes) and
   `--git-dir`/`--work-tree` stay banned.
5. The worker states its mode in its first heartbeat, so the overseer
   can read its later commands correctly.

The alternative fix — exempting worktree paths from the redundant-`-C`
denial so the GH-1028 mandate is always safe verbatim — was not taken:
the denial is correct guidance for a main session, and a self-test
that reports its own answer beats a rule that has to be right
everywhere.

## Re-running the `ToolSearch` bootstrap (GH-1063)

The bootstrap does not hold for a worker's whole life. Three
independent crew workers lost their Dev10x MCP surface after 60–90+
minutes: `create_pr` and `push_safe` became unreachable on tools they
had already loaded and already used.

Two of the three had pushed their work and lost only the final
PR/verify step. The third wedged pre-PR with a branch on origin and no
PR, and needed a fresh-spawn takeover to finish a chunk that was
substantively done.

Hence the retry line. It is a mitigation, not a fix — reconnect-on-demand
belongs in the wrapper layer and is tracked separately (GH-1072). What
the retry buys is preventing the worse failure: a worker that reads
"tool not found" as "this operation is impossible" improvises raw CLI
for a gated operation, which is exactly what the tool-surface split
exists to prevent. Full evidence:
[`tool-surface.md`](tool-surface.md) § MCP connectivity is not
permanent.

## Bounding the CI wait (GH-1088)

The § 4 anti-stall block pins `max_polls=10` and names a two-step
fallback — re-invoke once on an empty verdict, then read
`pr_get(...).statusCheckRollup`. Both halves are there because the
unbounded shape failed in the field.

A worker on the bravelabs-cms night run (2026-08-27) called
`ci_check_status(pr_number=27, wait=true)` after finishing delivery.
GitHub recorded both checks SUCCESS at 20:35:51Z. The worker never
returned from the call: heartbeat silent from 20:31Z, the stand-down
message never picked up, and the kill snippet at 21:25Z still read
"Now waiting on CI." Roughly 50 minutes past a verdict that had
already been decided.

That duration is the tell. The default poll budget is
`initial_wait 60 + poll_interval 30 × 39` = 1230s (~20.5 min), and
`dev10x.monitor` caps the subprocess at 1320s (22 min). A 50-minute
hang exceeds both ceilings, so it did not come from the poll loop —
it points at the subagent MCP connection death tracked in GH-1072.
Bounding the call cannot fix that, but it shortens the single
longest blocking MCP call a worker makes, which is the suspected
trigger.

The second worker in that same run avoided the hang only because its
brief happened to specify `max_polls=10` plus the fallback by hand.
Putting it in the template is what stops the next run rediscovering
it after a takeover.

GH-1088's other half — a fast path that returns immediately when the
verdict is already terminal at call time, so a late call costs one
API round trip instead of the 60s `initial_wait` — shipped
separately in `ci_check_status` itself.
