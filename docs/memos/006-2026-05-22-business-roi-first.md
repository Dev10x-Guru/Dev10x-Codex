# Business ROI First — A Manifesto for PR Titles, Job Stories, and Commit Messages

**Memo 006** · 2026-05-22 · Source: [GH-276](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/276)

> Every PR title, Job Story, and commit message owes the reader an answer to
> "where does the money come from or go?" — even when the answer is "platform
> integrity per the canonical bucket X." This memo is the doctrine that makes
> that answer mandatory. The skills are the enforcement. The annual audit is
> the renewal. None of these is sufficient alone.

## §1 — Why this memo exists

Consider this pull request, submitted this week by a conscientious engineer
on a mature SaaS codebase:

---

**PR title:** `Bump python-ulid to 2.1`

**Job Story:** "When a developer is adding client-side record creation,
the developer wants to use sortable, lexicographically ordered IDs,
so they can avoid coordination overhead with the server for ID
assignment."

---

This artifact passes every review check currently in operation.
The gitmoji is absent but that is a style concern, not a doctrine failure.
The Job Story is grammatically correct.
It names an actor, a motivation, and an outcome.
A reviewer scanning for the "developer-as-actor for plumbing PRs" failure
would likely wave it through, because the story sounds like a genuine
engineering concern rather than a feature masquerade.

The problem is what the story omits.
The library bump is groundwork for an atomic-save mutation.
The atomic-save mutation eliminates a class of support tickets.
The support tickets represent approximately two engineering-days per month
in interruption cost, and they block a self-service configuration feature
that three enterprise prospects have named as a procurement condition.
None of that is in the title, the story, or the commit message.
A stakeholder reading this artifact cannot answer the question:
"Should we be doing this, and does it deserve to go first?"

This is GH-276.
The developer-as-actor shape for plumbing PRs slips past review
because it satisfies the *form* of a Job Story while evacuating the
*substance* the form was invented to carry.
The engineer is not a liar.
The story they wrote is true.
It is simply addressed to the wrong audience, terminating at the wrong
point in the dependency chain.

That failure mode is narrow.
The wider failure mode it belongs to is not.

Teams that adopt outcome-first conventions — Job Stories, JTBD, OKRs —
discover over time that the conventions accumulate their own rituals.
Stories get written because the PR template requires them.
Commit messages adopt the approved verbs.
Reviews pass artifacts that satisfy the checklist without asking whether
the checklist still serves its original purpose.
The supervisor quoted in this memo's commissioning note names the dynamic
precisely:

> "instead of YAGNI we just assume that there is a good reason for it
> but I am not privy to it, the others must know why, and bureaucracy
> creeps in."

Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) documented the underlying mechanism:
decision-makers systematically over-weight the status quo, assigning it
a legitimacy that incoming evidence rarely dislodges.
Parkinson (1957) named the organisational form it takes —
the Law of Triviality, where committees spend disproportionate time on
low-stakes, legible items and wave through high-stakes, opaque ones.
Applied to code review: a grammatically correct Job Story is legible;
the business logic it should be encoding is opaque;
the reviewer defaults to approving the legible surface.

The cost accumulates slowly and becomes visible only in aggregate.
Stakeholders who routinely receive engineering-centric framing —
titles that describe diffs rather than decisions, stories that name
developers rather than customers — lose the ability to prioritise
across competing work items, to allocate capacity against business
outcomes, or to measure return on engineering investment.
Schwartz (2016, 2017) documents the structural version of this failure:
IT organisations that cannot articulate business value in their own
language are treated as cost centres rather than co-authors of outcomes.
Cagan (2017) frames the same gap in product terms: "feature teams"
optimising output diverge from "product teams" optimising outcomes, and
the divergence compounds.
Thorp (1998) named the phenomenon the Information Paradox —
organisations invest heavily in IT and cannot explain what they got.

The claim that *framing changes decisions* is not rhetorical.
Four bodies of peer-reviewed evidence substantiate it directly.
Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann (1983) established through the Elaboration
Likelihood Model that high-involvement audiences — the stakeholders
evaluating budget allocation — process benefit-outcome arguments via the
central deliberative route, producing more durable attitude change than
mechanism-first arguments.
Rackham (1988) analysed 35,000 recorded sales calls and found that
large-account success depended not on feature enumeration but on
implication-and-need-payoff sequences: articulating the downstream
consequence first, then naming the mechanism that resolves it.
Loewenstein and Prelec (1992) demonstrated hyperbolic discounting in
intertemporal choice: decision-makers heavily discount deferred outcomes
and over-weight immediate costs, meaning that a PR titled "Enable
same-day customer configuration rollout" activates the future-value
representation that counteracts that bias, while "Bump python-ulid to 2.1"
does not.
Trope and Liberman (2010) showed through construal-level theory that
psychologically distant targets — future releases, strategic goals —
are represented at high construal (outcomes, "why"), while near targets
are represented at low construal (mechanisms, "how");
outcome language aligns with the mental model stakeholders use for
strategic evaluation, while mechanism language mismatches it.

These four results convert the rhetorical claim into an empirical one.
Outcome-framed artifacts do not merely signal effort or competence.
They change which work gets funded, which gets deferred, and which gets
cancelled — because they operate on the cognitive machinery that those
decisions run on.

This memo stakes a position: every artifact — PR title, Job Story,
commit message — owes the reader a legible answer to the question
"where does the money come from or go?"
Not a vague reference to engineering quality.
Not a story about what the developer wants.
An answer traceable, in a small number of steps, to a business actor
whose situation changes as a result of the work being shipped.

## §2 — Doctrine: the ROI rationale rule

Every engineering artifact that describes a change — PR title, Job Story,
commit message — must carry a ROI rationale.
The rationale is not decoration; it is the load-bearing claim that
justifies the act of shipping (Drucker 1963).

**The default rule:**
Every artifact names (a) which ROI bucket the change serves and
(b) which actor outside engineering benefits from it.

The six recognised buckets are:

| Bucket | Value signal |
|---|---|
| Revenue | Increases billable events, conversion, or average order value |
| Cost | Reduces infrastructure, labour, or support spend |
| Retention | Reduces churn or improves measured satisfaction |
| Time-to-value | Shortens the gap between intent and outcome for a user |
| Risk | Reduces probability or blast radius of a failure state |
| Platform integrity | Preserves the system's capacity to deliver the above |

An artifact that names no bucket produces no signal.
The reader cannot distinguish purposeful work from box-ticking work
(Graeber 2018).
Ambiguity here is not neutral — it is a continuous loss at every
downstream decision point: review, prioritisation, incident triage
(Taguchi 1986).

**The exception:**
Canonical platform overhead work — catalogued in §5 — is exempt
from naming an external beneficiary.
Dependency upgrades, test infrastructure, linter hygiene, and
similarly well-bounded maintenance items have standing rationales
that are not re-litigated per commit.

**The hard edge:**
Claiming the exception requires two conditions, both necessary:

1. The artifact matches an existing canonical bucket **by name**
   (not by analogy, not by spirit).
2. The author can recite that bucket's one-line rationale
   from the §5 catalogue.

Neither condition alone is sufficient.
A name without a recitable rationale is cargo-culted compliance.
A rationale without a canonical name is an ad-hoc claim competing for
exception status — which is exactly what the default rule exists to prevent.

**Why this resists bureaucracy creep:**
The recitation requirement forces a conscious choice (Drucker 1967).
"We've always done it this way" is not a rationale; it is evidence that
the exception has been claimed unconsciously.
Goldratt and Cox (1984) identified the same failure mode in production
systems: local efficiency metrics optimise the step, not the system.
A commit that improves local tidiness while obscuring business value
optimises the wrong level.
The poka-yoke here (Shingo 1989) is structural: the canonical catalogue
in §5 is finite and versioned.
If the work does not appear in it, the default rule applies — no
override, no appeal to precedent.

## §3 — The Five Lenses (toolkit)

The doctrine does not prescribe a single algorithm;
it provides five complementary lenses,
each sharpened for a different class of change.

| # | Lens | Best for | Key move |
|---|------|----------|----------|
| 3.1 | Trace-upward | Plumbing, refactor, dep bumps, infra | Walk dependency graph from your diff outward until you hit someone outside engineering |
| 3.2 | 5 Whys | Ops hygiene, "obvious" work, bug-fix root cause | Drill on motivation in 5 forced iterations; terminate ONLY on a business answer |
| 3.3 | Mechanism vs Outcome | Universal vocabulary | Name both halves; suppress mechanism in titles; lead with outcome |
| 3.4 | ROI buckets | Classifying the found outcome | Pick exactly ONE primary bucket — stacking inflates pseudo-value |
| 3.5 | CFO "so what?" test | Universal final check | Read aloud to imagined non-tech stakeholder; iterate until "so what?" stops |

---

### §3.1 — Trace-upward

**When to use it.**
Trace-upward is the primary lens for changes
that are structurally invisible to end users:
dependency bumps, database migrations,
infrastructure reconfigurations, internal refactors,
and compiler or toolchain upgrades.
Nothing in the diff is a feature;
everything in the diff is a precondition for something that is.

**The mechanic.**
Begin at the diff itself.
Ask: "Who consumes the output of this code?"
Name that consumer and repeat the question.
Continue until the answer is a person or system
that is not on the engineering team —
a customer, a downstream partner, a finance process,
a regulatory obligation.
The final non-engineering node in that chain
is the beneficiary the title must name (Ulwick 2002).
The path from diff to beneficiary
is the dependency graph that justifies the work.
Record it;
it becomes the evidence behind the claim.

**Example.**
Naive: "Bump SQLAlchemy from 1.4 to 2.0."
Lens applied: SQLAlchemy is consumed by the ORM layer →
the ORM layer powers the checkout API →
the checkout API is the path to payment capture →
payment capture is the revenue mechanism for merchants.
Result: "Enable checkout reliability for merchants
by migrating ORM to SQLAlchemy 2.0" (Ulwick 2016;
Christensen et al. 2016b).

**Pitfalls.**
The canonical trap is stopping at "the developer" —
concluding that the beneficiary is the team itself
("enables us to upgrade Python").
This is the GH-276 pattern:
the dependency graph terminated prematurely,
and the real downstream beneficiary was never surfaced.
A developer is a conduit, not a terminus.
The graph must exit engineering entirely.

**Source backing.**
Ulwick (2002) establishes outcome-driven innovation
as anchored to the job executor, not the implementer.
Ulwick (2016) and Christensen et al. (2016b)
reinforce that value claims require a named beneficiary
outside the value-creation chain itself.

---

### §3.2 — 5 Whys

**When to use it.**
5 Whys is most effective when the motivation feels self-evident —
ops hygiene, obvious maintenance,
or a bug fix where the developer already "knows" the cause.
Self-evidence is precisely the condition under which root cause
is most likely to be stated rather than discovered.

**The mechanic.**
Write the technical action.
Ask "Why does this matter?" and write the answer.
Repeat four more times,
treating each previous answer as the new subject.
Accept an iteration as complete
only if the answer names a business state:
revenue, risk, cost, compliance, or user outcome.
A technical answer ("because it works," "because it's correct")
is a sign the chain has not reached the required depth;
continue drilling (Ohno 1988).
Five iterations is a forcing function, not a ceiling.

**Example.**
Naive: "Fix null pointer in session handler."
Why? Prevents crashes. Why does that matter?
Users can complete sessions. Why does that matter?
Sessions are the activation mechanism for paid accounts.
Why does that matter?
Activation rate drives first-month retention.
Result: "Protect first-month retention
by eliminating null pointer in session handler."

**Pitfalls.**
The well-documented failure mode is termination on a technical answer —
"because it works" or "because the test passes"
(Card 2017; Peerally et al. 2017).
Ohno's original framing targeted machine stoppages
with clear causal chains;
applied to software, causation is often jointly sufficient
rather than singular (Allspaw 2012),
and drilling past a legitimate joint cause
can produce spurious business framing.
The corrective is Ishikawa's fishbone complement (Ishikawa 1985):
when multiple causes converge,
name the dominant path rather than forcing a single trunk.
Imai (1986) grounds the method's orientation —
the terminal answer should point toward consumer value,
tracing back from Toyoda Sakichi's jidoka principle (c. 1900s).

**Source backing.**
Ohno (1988) for the foundational method.
Card (2017) and Peerally et al. (2017)
for the canonical critique of premature termination.
Allspaw (2012) on jointly-sufficient causation in complex systems.

---

### §3.3 — Mechanism vs Outcome

**When to use it.**
This lens applies universally.
Every change has a mechanism — what was done —
and an outcome — what that enables.
The lens is not a discovery tool;
it is a vocabulary tool that prevents the two halves
from collapsing into each other.

**The mechanic.**
Write two explicit sentences.
First: "The mechanism is [X]."
Second: "The outcome is [Y]."
For PR titles and commit subjects: lead with Y, suppress X,
or reduce X to a subordinate phrase.
For PR bodies and commit descriptions:
state both, in that order (Klement 2013).

**Example.**
Naive: "Add lazy-loading to product image component."
Mechanism: "Lazy-loading is added to product image component."
Outcome: "Page load time drops below the 2.5-second LCP threshold,
keeping product pages eligible for Google Shopping impressions."
Result title: "Protect Shopping impression eligibility
by lazy-loading product images" (Cohn 2004; Lucassen et al. 2016).

**Pitfalls.**
The most common failure is a pseudo-business outcome —
a phrase that sounds like an outcome
but is actually a redescription of the mechanism
at a higher abstraction level.
"Better separation of concerns," "improved modularity,"
and "cleaner architecture"
are mechanisms described in architectural vocabulary;
they are not outcomes (Lucassen et al. 2016).
An outcome must be falsifiable from outside engineering:
a stakeholder with no technical background
must be able to confirm or deny that it occurred.

**Source backing.**
Klement (2013) on the distinction between process and outcome
in jobs-to-be-done framing.
Cohn (2004) on user story structure as outcome-first.
Lucassen et al. (2016) on quality criteria
for outcome statements in agile artifacts.

---

### §3.4 — ROI buckets

**When to use it.**
Once Trace-upward, 5 Whys, or Mechanism vs Outcome
has surfaced a candidate outcome,
ROI buckets provide classification scaffolding.
The lens answers: what *kind* of value is this?
Classification is not decoration;
it determines which stakeholder reads the artifact,
what success metric applies,
and whether the claim is testable.

**The mechanic.**
The six-bucket scheme
— Revenue captured, Cost saved, Retention,
Time-to-value, Risk avoided, and Platform integrity —
is not Dev10x-original.
It tracks the Cranfield benefits taxonomy
as articulated in Ward & Daniel (2006),
which grounds benefits realization in empirically-derived categories
drawn from enterprise IS investment analysis.
This heritage is load-bearing:
the bucket list is not arbitrary;
it reflects decades of portfolio ROI research
(Kaplan & Norton 1992; Thorp 1998;
Treacy & Wiersema 1993; Holbrook 1999;
Reinertsen 2009; Kersten 2018).
Select exactly ONE primary bucket.
Write a single sentence that names the bucket-specific metric
the outcome moves.

**Example.**
Outcome candidate: "Merchants can retry failed payments."
Possible buckets: Revenue captured (recovery increases GMV),
Risk avoided (fewer chargebacks).
Primary: Revenue captured.
Result: "Recover declined-payment revenue
by enabling merchant-initiated retries."

**Pitfalls.**
Stacking buckets —
"reduces cost, improves UX, and mitigates risk" —
inflates apparent value
while reducing specificity to zero.
A stakeholder reading a three-bucket claim
cannot identify the success metric,
cannot assign ownership,
and cannot validate the outcome post-deployment.
When two buckets are genuinely co-primary,
choose the one that moves the larger metric
and note the secondary in the body,
not the title (Reinertsen 2009).

**Source backing.**
Ward & Daniel (2006) as the primary grounding
for the non-arbitrariness of the six-bucket scheme.
Reinertsen (2009) on cost-of-delay
as the canonical single-dimension framing.
Kersten (2018) on flow metrics and value stream alignment.

---

### §3.5 — CFO "so what?" test

**When to use it.**
This lens is the final gate, applied universally,
after any other lens has produced a candidate title.
It is not a discovery tool;
it is a rejection test.
A title that passes the other four lenses
but fails this test
has produced the right insight with the wrong expression.

**The mechanic.**
Read the candidate title aloud.
Imagine a non-technical stakeholder —
the CFO is the canonical proxy,
not because CFOs are the only audience,
but because they represent the sharpest version
of financially-literate, context-free scrutiny.
If the imagined response is "so what?",
the title has not reached a business-state claim.
Revise once.
If the revised title still draws "so what?",
return to the upstream lens that generated the outcome
and drill deeper.
One or two iterations is the expected pattern;
more than three indicates
the outcome has not yet been found (Heath & Heath 2007;
Sinek 2009).

**Example.**
Candidate: "Enable OAuth token refresh."
CFO response: "So what?"
Revised: "Prevent logged-out users during long sessions."
CFO response: "So what?"
Revised: "Protect session continuity
for high-value checkout flows."
CFO response: silence.
Result: accepted (Minto 1987/2002;
Gawande 2009 on checklist termination conditions).

**Pitfalls.**
The test is frequently misapplied
by writing FOR the CFO
rather than using the CFO as an audience for the *test*.
A title written in finance vocabulary —
"Increase ARR retention cohort by reducing involuntary churn" —
may pass the test but violates the actor-centred voice
required by the doctrine.
The CFO is the imagined judge of sufficiency,
not the named beneficiary in the artifact.
The artifact's beneficiary
is always the actor who does the job (Sinek 2009;
Minto 1987/2002).

**Source backing.**
Heath & Heath (2007) on the curse of knowledge
and the practitioner need for external-audience testing.
Sinek (2009) on the primacy of "why" in stakeholder communication.
Gawande (2009) on checklist design and termination conditions.
Minto (1987/2002) Pyramid Principle
on leading with the answer
as the foundational practitioner evidence
for outcome-first expression.

## §4 — Scenario taxonomy: which lens fits which change type

No single lens dominates across all change types.
The matrix below provides a structured selection guide:
rows represent change types, columns represent the five lenses
introduced in §3, and each cell signals whether that lens is
the primary framing (★), a useful supplement (✓),
neutral (—), or actively misleading (✗).
Apply the starred lens or lenses first;
treat ✓ cells as optional enrichment and ✗ cells as traps.

| Change type | Trace-up | 5 Whys | Mech/Outcome | ROI bucket | CFO test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| New customer feature | ✓ shallow | ✓ | ★ universal | ★ Revenue/Retention | ★ |
| Bug fix breaking business activity | ✓ | ★ consequence chain | ★ | ★ Cost/Risk | ★ |
| Plumbing (refactor, dep bump) | ★ dominant | ✓ | ★ | ★ Time-to-value | ★ |
| Operational hygiene (rotation, refresh) | ✗ dead-ends | ★ | — | ★ Platform integrity | ★ + canonical bucket |
| Regulatory-forced | — | ★ | ✓ | ★ Risk + Revenue | ★ |
| Performance / reliability | ✓ | ✓ | ★ | ★ Time-to-value/Retention | ★ |
| Internal tooling shipping operator value | ✗ engineer IS the actor | ✓ | ★ | ★ Cost/Retention | ★ |
| Pure tech-debt paydown (no downstream feature) | ✗ no actor | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✗ fails — bundle or hold |

Two rows show Trace-upward rated ✗: *Operational hygiene* and
*Pure tech-debt paydown*.
This failure is intentional diagnostic signal, not a gap in the framework.
When the trace-up chain terminates without reaching a business actor
or outcome, it means one of two things:
the change belongs to canonical platform overhead — a standing cost
that needs no per-PR justification (addressed in §5) —
or it lacks sufficient downstream effect to justify an isolated commit,
triggering the bundle-or-hold rule discussed in §7.
A PR that cannot survive a trace-up attempt and cannot be assigned
to a platform overhead bucket should not ship as a standalone change;
the cost of the cognitive overhead it imposes on reviewers
exceeds the value of the diff.

The *Internal tooling shipping operator value* row presents a
superficially similar problem: the engineer is the actor,
so tracing "up" from engineer to business stakeholder loops back
to the same role.
This is not a dead-end — it is a legitimate actor boundary.
When internal operators are the customers,
the Mechanism/Outcome and ROI-bucket lenses (Cost/Retention)
supply the needed framing without requiring an external stakeholder.
Section §6 demonstrates this pattern in full through worked examples
D1 and D2, showing how operator-facing changes achieve CFO-test
compliance without a trace-up chain.

The CFO test column carries ★ on every row without exception.
This uniformity is the section's central claim:
regardless of change type, every PR title and commit message
must survive a CFO reading them cold and being able to answer
"what business outcome does this protect or advance?"
The other lenses vary by context;
the CFO test is the invariant constraint that anchors all of them.

## §5 — Platform overhead: the YAGNI inversion

### Move 1 — Name the trap

Every engineering team accumulates a class of work that resists
ROI articulation on first glance.
The rotation is due.
The cert expires.
The dependency has a CVE.
These are real obligations, and the team knows it.
But the moment a team internalises that certain work *just needs doing*,
it creates a gravitational well:
tasks that are difficult to explain get pulled toward the same label.

The label is "platform overhead."

Used precisely, it names a narrow and legitimate category.
Used as a default, it names everything the author did not want to justify.
The mechanism is not malice — it is the path of least resistance.
When ROI articulation requires effort and the audience is not present
to push back, the cost of writing "platform overhead" is zero.
Parkinson (1957) documented the same dynamic in committee governance:
discussion time is inversely proportional to the cost of the item
because complex decisions intimidate while trivial ones invite
participation.
The Law of Triviality predicts exactly what happens to the
"platform overhead" bucket under minimal scrutiny:
it grows, because adding an entry is easier than questioning one.

Graeber (2018) extends the analysis from committees to organisations at
scale.
"Box-ticking" work — effort whose primary output is evidence that the
effort was performed — justifies itself through process compliance
rather than business outcome.
The box is ticked, the overhead is logged, the PR is merged.
No one is lying.
Everyone is performing a ritual whose founding rationale has been
forgotten or was never written down.

This is the YAGNI inversion.
The original YAGNI principle — You Ain't Gonna Need It — demands
justification before addition.
Its inversion, which has no name in the literature but is everywhere
in practice, demands justification only for *removal*.
The default assumption shifts:
*we must need it, because we always do it.*
As §1 frames it in the user's own words, the team does not question
the practice;
it assumes "there is a good reason for it but I am not privy to it,
the others must know why."
The muscle of asking "but why?" atrophies.
Bureaucracy creeps in not through any single bad decision
but through the accumulated weight of unjustified continuation.

The cost is not merely philosophical.
Drucker (1963) identified the failure mode precisely:
it is possible to do efficiently what should not be done at all.
Fowler (2003) translates this to software:
work performed without a rationale is inadvertent technical debt —
not the deliberate borrowing against future delivery,
but the slow accumulation of obligation that was never consciously chosen.

### Move 2 — State the doctrine

Platform overhead is a legitimate ROI bucket.
It is not a fiction or a bureaucratic excuse for every team that uses it
with precision.
But it is the **narrowest** bucket in the taxonomy,
not the default.

The doctrine is this:
every canonical platform overhead entry is pre-justified,
named, and rationale-carrying.
The team agrees, in advance and in writing,
on a finite list of entry types — each with a one-line canonical
rationale that any team member can recite from memory.
The entry exists *because* the team has reasoned through it,
not because the work arrived and the author needed a category.

The bucket list is curated and versioned.
"We've always done it" is not an entry.
"Someone told me this is important" is not an entry.
An entry requires a named, durable business rationale —
the kind that would survive a CFO asking "so what happens if we stop?"

Womack & Jones (1996) name this the first principle of Lean:
value must be specified from the customer's perspective.
Platform integrity is a customer-perspective value —
but only when the entry spells out *which* customer risk is being
managed and *what* it costs to leave that risk unmanaged.
Without that specification, the entry is not Lean — it is waste
wearing the uniform of process.

### Move 3 — Provide the hard edge

Invoking the platform overhead exception requires two things,
both non-negotiable.

First, the author must match the work to a **specific canonical entry by
name**.
Not the bucket category, not a paraphrase — the exact name as it
appears in the canonical table below.

Second, the author must be able to recite that entry's canonical
one-line rationale **from memory or by direct paste from this section**.
Recitation distinguishes understanding from pattern-matching.
A team member who has internalised why secret rotation exists will
not rotate tokens on the wrong cadence or skip the rotation when
the scheduled date is inconvenient.
A team member who has memorised the label but not the rationale will.

Adding a new canonical entry is not a unilateral act.
It requires a team-wide ADR documenting:
the business obligation the entry names,
the downstream harm if the entry is not performed,
the recurrence logic (what triggers the work),
and — critically — **cessation criteria**: the condition under which
this entry is retired from the canonical list.
Cessation criteria prevent the canonical list from becoming a black hole
for work that once had a rationale but has outlived it.
A compliance control relevant to a former regulatory framework,
a certificate rotation that was made obsolete by an automated platform —
these must be removable.
Without a cessation criterion, the canonical list becomes the same
bureaucracy it was designed to prevent.

Taguchi (1986) frames every ambiguity as a continuous cost — a loss
function, not a binary pass/fail.
Every canonical entry that cannot survive the recitation test is a
running loss on team attention and delivery throughput.
Shingo (1981/1989) would say the defect must be surfaced before it
passes to the next stage of work:
the recitation requirement is the poka-yoke for the overhead bucket.

---

The following table represents the initial canonical entries.
It is expected to evolve.
Additions require ADR and cessation criteria.
Deletions require evidence that the underlying obligation has been
retired or automated away.

| Bucket | One-line canonical rationale | Recurrence |
|--------|------------------------------|------------|
| Release version bumps | Versioned releases let downstream consumers pin to known-good combinations and roll back deterministically; without versioning, every consumer becomes a regression-test target. | Per release |
| Security cert / secret rotation | Periodic rotation ensures undetected credential compromise cannot persist beyond the rotation window, maintaining PCI / SOC2 / customer-trust posture. | Quarterly / per policy |
| Scheduled dependency security refresh | Tracking upstream CVEs and applying patches within published SLA windows prevents known vulnerabilities from being exploited. | Monthly / per CVE |
| Database backup / restore rehearsals | Backups are worthless without provable restore capability; periodic rehearsal converts "we have backups" into "we have recovery." | Quarterly |
| Compliance audit-log evidence collection | External auditors require periodic evidence packs (SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR Art 30 ROPA) that demand a recurring effort cycle; collecting on-demand is more costly than scheduling. | Per audit cycle |
| License / certificate renewals | Software licences and TLS certificates have hard expiry dates that, if missed, cause customer-facing outages; renewal is risk-avoided cost. | Per expiry calendar |

**Borderline cases and entries that do not qualify alone.**
Field-rename migrations, refactors, and dependency bumps
*without a downstream feature pending* do not qualify as
canonical platform overhead entries.
They share the surface form — recurring, unglamorous, necessary-seeming —
but they fail the test:
no entry in the table covers them, and they cannot invoke the exception.

These cases push back to the default rule:
name the downstream outcome, or do not ship alone.
This is the bundle-or-hold principle developed in §7:
a refactor with no named downstream feature either waits until the
feature ships and travels with it, or it earns its own explicit
outcome rationale before merging solo.
The burden of proof does not disappear because the work is mechanical
or because the author is confident it is worthwhile.

**Why this matters for the broader doctrine.**
The canonical-bucket mechanism is not punitive.
It is the safety valve that makes the default rule workable.
Without it, the rule "every artifact owes a ROI rationale" generates
a class of pseudo-Job-Stories for genuinely recurring obligations —
stories that strain to name a business actor for work that has no
meaningful actor other than the team's own operational hygiene.
With the mechanism in place, those cases have a clean exit:
match the entry, recite the rationale, and the obligation is satisfied.
The recitation requirement keeps the exit honest.

---

The §8 reflection tool operationalises an annual review of every
canonical-bucket entry.
If a bucket cannot survive its own annual review — if the team cannot
answer "what would break, and for whom?" — it is a candidate for
retirement or restructure.
The annual review is the cessation-criteria check made routine.

## §6 — Worked examples

Eight worked examples follow, organised into the four scenario categories
introduced in §4: **A1–A2** (revenue baseline — a customer feature and a
bug fix that breaks a business activity), **B1–B2** (plumbing — the GH-276
headline dep-bump case and Example 5 from the existing `jtbd` skill redone
correctly), **C1–C2** (operational hygiene with the canonical-bucket safety
valve, and regulatory-forced work that still earns a real beneficiary
story), **D1–D2** (legitimate engineer-as-actor cases that still trace
upward to org-level outcomes).

Each example follows the same uniform format: scenario context, naïve
draft, lens-by-lens application, best-fit lens identified, final drafts
(PR title + Job Story + commit message), and a "why this wins" contrast
paragraph. The examples are intentionally generic-business — no specific
tenant, customer, or product names appear, per the issue 276 acceptance
criterion that examples stay generic.

After the eight examples, a coverage table verifies that every ROI bucket
from §3.4 lands in at least one worked example.

### A1. New customer feature — ACH payment method

**Scenario.**
An e-commerce SaaS allows merchants to record how a customer paid at point of sale.
Enterprise customers routinely pay by ACH bank transfer, but the application's
`PaymentMethod` enum offers no ACH option — those transactions land under "Other,"
breaking bank reconciliation.
Sub-ticket FEAT-401 closes this gap; the parent ticket (FEAT-398) records the
immediate business pressure: enterprise clients have been requesting the option
for two quarters and some accounts have stalled at procurement because of it.

**Naïve draft.**
```
Add ACH to PaymentMethod enum
```

**Trace-up at a glance:**

```
✨ ACH enum addition (FEAT-401)                    ← the diff
  └─ Cashier selects 'ACH' at point of sale
       └─ Merchant reconciliation stops grouping as 'Other'
            └─ Accounting team closes month-end without manual fixes
                 └─ Enterprise procurement reviewers see complete story
                      └─ Enterprise sales pipeline unblocks
                         (multi-year contracts = high LTV cohort)
```

**Lens application:**

- **Trace-upward**: The diff adds one enum value and one UI dropdown item — a
  trivially small change.
  Tracing outward: the new option reaches the cashier's screen → the cashier
  classifies the payment correctly → the merchant's reconciliation report stops
  grouping ACH receipts under "Other" → the accounting team closes month-end
  without manual adjustments → enterprise procurement reviewers see a complete
  payment method story → the sales pipeline unblocks.
  The naïve draft stops at the first link; tracing to the sixth reveals the
  actual value.

- **5 Whys**: Why add the enum value?
  Enterprise customers request it.
  Why does that matter?
  Their accounts-payable processes only authorise ACH; card payments are not an
  option.
  Why does authorisation matter?
  Without ACH, they will not sign.
  Why does signing matter?
  Enterprise contracts run multi-year and represent the highest lifetime value
  cohort.
  Why does LTV matter?
  The business depends on recurring revenue, and the Q3 pipeline is stalled on
  this gap.

- **Mechanism vs Outcome**: The mechanism is a new enum constant and a matching
  dropdown option — two lines of code.
  The outcome is accurate ACH reconciliation for enterprise merchants and an
  unblocked enterprise sales pipeline.
  The naïve draft names only the mechanism; the outcome is invisible to any
  reviewer who did not read the parent ticket.

- **ROI buckets**: The primary bucket is **Revenue captured** — enterprise deals
  that were stalling at the "no ACH" objection can now proceed.
  A secondary bucket is **Cost saved** — merchants were manually reclassifying
  "Other" transactions during reconciliation; that labour disappears.
  Stacking both in the title would dilute the message; the revenue bucket
  dominates and should lead.

- **CFO "so what?" test**: Hearing "Add ACH to PaymentMethod enum," a CFO
  asks, "So what? We add fields all the time."
  Hearing "Enable enterprise ACH payment reconciliation," the same CFO responds:
  "Good — that's been sitting on the enterprise pipeline review since Q2."
  The revised framing connects the change to a named business consequence without
  requiring the audience to read the ticket.

**Best-fit lens:**
Trace-upward dominates here because the diff itself is mechanically trivial —
there is no dramatic consequence chain to drill through with 5 Whys, and the
ROI bucket (revenue) is already visible once the dependency graph is walked one
level at a time.
Trace-upward is the shortest path from "one enum value" to "enterprise pipeline
unblocked," and that path is the entire argument for shipping the change.

**Final drafts:**

- **PR title**: `✨ FEAT-401 Enable enterprise ACH payment reconciliation`
- **Job Story**: "**When** a merchant processes an ACH bank transfer for an
  order, **the cashier wants to** select 'ACH' as the payment method,
  **so the merchant can** accurately reconcile bank transfer transactions
  instead of grouping them under 'Other'."
- **Commit**: `✨ FEAT-401 Enable enterprise ACH payment reconciliation`

**Why this wins.**
The naïve draft is technically accurate — it names the class and the operation —
but it gives a reviewer no reason to approve the change faster than any other
enum addition.
The final title names the beneficiary (enterprise merchants), the activity
(reconciliation), and the implicit consequence (deals stop stalling), which
means any product stakeholder reading the PR list can classify it correctly
without opening the ticket.
The Job Story makes the cashier the named actor, keeping the story grounded in
observable behaviour rather than abstract "enterprise needs."

### A2. Bug fix — month-end payroll calculation timeout

**Scenario.**
A payroll SaaS runs `PayrollCalculator.summarise_deductions()` for every
employee during a batch close.
Under normal load the calculation completes in approximately four seconds;
during month-end closing, when the batch size triples, it exceeds the
sixty-second query timeout.
The finance team is paged at 2 a.m., the batch fails, and employees are not
paid on time.
BUG-500 traces the root cause to an N+1 query inside `summarise_deductions()`;
the fix is a single `prefetch_related` call.

**Naïve draft.**
```
Fix N+1 query in PayrollCalculator
```

**Trace-up at a glance:**

```
🐛 N+1 query fix in PayrollCalculator (BUG-500)    ← the diff
  └─ Calculation completes within timeout window
       └─ Month-end payroll batch closes on schedule
            └─ Employees paid by scheduled pay date
                 └─ Finance team not paged at 2 a.m.
                      └─ Labour-law liability avoided
                         + finance trust in platform restored
```

**Lens application:**

- **Trace-upward**: The diff is one line — a `prefetch_related` annotation.
  Tracing outward: the query is optimised → the calculation completes within the
  timeout window → the batch closes on schedule → employees are paid on time →
  the finance team is not paged at 2 a.m.
  Trace-upward surfaces the consequence chain, but the chain is long enough that
  5 Whys does the same work more systematically — the consequence at the end of
  the chain (2 a.m. page, potential labour-law liability) is far removed from the
  technical cause.

- **5 Whys**: Why fix the N+1 query?
  The calculation times out during month-end closing.
  Why does a timeout matter?
  The payroll batch fails.
  Why does batch failure matter?
  Employees are not paid by their scheduled pay date.
  Why does a missed pay date matter?
  The finance team is paged in the middle of the night and the company risks
  labour-law non-compliance.
  Why does that risk matter?
  Regulatory fines, employee trust erosion, and potential class-action liability
  for a payroll provider.
  The 5 Whys chain terminates on a risk-and-retention answer that the naïve
  draft buries completely.

- **Mechanism vs Outcome**: The mechanism is `prefetch_related('deductions__category')` —
  a Django query optimisation.
  The outcome is predictable, on-time month-end payroll completion.
  These are not the same claim; the mechanism is opaque to any stakeholder who
  does not know what N+1 means, while the outcome is immediately legible to the
  finance team that gets paged.

- **ROI buckets**: The primary bucket is **Risk avoided** — late payment
  exposure and regulatory liability are the most severe consequences.
  Secondary buckets are **Cost saved** (on-call hours eliminated) and
  **Retention** (finance team confidence in the platform is restored).
  The risk bucket should lead in the title because it names the event that
  triggered the ticket — the 2 a.m. page and its downstream consequences.

- **CFO "so what?" test**: Hearing "Fix N+1 query in PayrollCalculator," a
  CFO asks, "What is an N+1 query, and why is this urgent?"
  Hearing "Stop month-end payroll calculation from timing out," the same CFO
  responds: "Yes — fix that before the next month-end close."
  The revised title communicates urgency and business context without requiring
  the audience to understand database query patterns.

**Best-fit lens:**
5 Whys dominates here because the gap between the technical cause (one
inefficient query) and the business consequence (regulatory exposure, employee
payment failure) is large enough that a simple trace-upward pass risks
stopping too early — at "the calculation is faster," which is still
mechanism-speak.
5 Whys forces five explicit iterations, and the business answer only appears
at iteration four or five; the discipline of the drill is what makes the
consequence visible.

**Final drafts:**

- **PR title**: `🐛 BUG-500 Stop month-end payroll calculation from timing out`
- **Job Story**: "**When** running payroll during month-end closing,
  **the payroll manager wants** the calculation to complete reliably,
  **so the finance team can** avoid missed pay dates and 2 a.m. pages."
- **Commit**: `🐛 BUG-500 Stop month-end payroll calculation from timing out`

**Why this wins.**
The naïve draft is comprehensible to an engineer reviewing the implementation
but invisible to every other stakeholder deciding whether to prioritise the
fix.
The final title names the event (month-end closing), the failure mode (timing
out), and implicitly names the consequence (the finance team knows exactly what
a timeout during closing means).
The Job Story adds the payroll manager as the named actor, grounding the
abstract timeout event in a human experience — which is precisely the
information a product manager needs to communicate urgency to engineering
leadership.

### B1. Dependency Bump: ULID Enables Atomic-Save

**Scenario.**
A multi-tenant SaaS configurator lets customers manage their own form templates
through row-level CRUD GraphQL mutations — one row saved at a time.
The architecture roadmap collapses that surface into a single atomic-document
mutation, requiring client-side ID generation as a prerequisite.
CFG-823 tracks adoption of ULIDs to satisfy that prerequisite.

**Naïve draft.**

```
Bump python-ulid to 2.1.0
```

Job Story: "**When** implementing atomic save, **the developer wants to**
use sortable client-side IDs, **so they can** avoid coordination overhead."

This naïve draft is the GH-276 headline anti-pattern verbatim:
the actor is the developer, the benefit is an implementation convenience,
and the business chain is severed at the first link.

**Trace-up at a glance:**

```
📦 ULID library dependency bump (CFG-823)          ← the diff
  └─ Enables client-side ID generation
       └─ Enables atomic-document save mutation
            └─ Makes configurator UI usable for end customers
                 └─ End customers self-serve template config
                      └─ Vendor saves support hours
                         + customers ship config same-day
```

**Lens application:**

- **Trace-upward**: A ULID dep bump enables client-side ID generation,
  which enables an atomic-save mutation,
  which makes the configurator UI usable enough for end customers to self-serve —
  collapsing support hours and enabling same-day config rollout.
- **5 Whys**: Why ULID? Sortable client IDs. Why those? Atomic save requires
  client-generated IDs. Why atomic save? Config edits land in one transaction.
  Why does that matter? Same-day rollout and no half-saved templates.
  Why does *that* matter? Customers stop opening support tickets; vendors stop
  absorbing the labour cost.
- **Mechanism vs Outcome**: The mechanism is a library upgrade.
  The outcome is end-customer self-service configuration with same-day deployment.
  The two are four causal steps apart.
- **ROI buckets**: Primary bucket is Cost saved — support hours eliminated when
  customers no longer need vendor assistance for routine config edits.
  Secondary is Time-to-value — same-day config rollout vs. next-sprint vendor
  deployment. Tertiary is Retention — customers who can act on time-sensitive
  promotions without filing a ticket are less likely to churn.
- **CFO "so what?" test**: "Bump ulid" produces a blank stare.
  "First step toward end-customer self-service configuration" produces a
  follow-up question about the timeline — the CFO is now engaged with the
  business case, not the library version number.

**Best-fit lens:**
Trace-upward dominates here because the diff is a dependency bump sitting four
causal layers below the actor who realises the value.
No amount of 5 Whys or mechanism-framing shortcuts that distance;
the author must literally walk the chain to surface the correct actor and
beneficiary.
This is the defining characteristic of the GH-276 headline case: when the
diff is infrastructure groundwork, only tracing upward finds the business edge.

**Final drafts:**

- **PR title**: `📦 CFG-823 Enable end-customer self-service configuration (atomic-save groundwork)`
- **Job Story**: "**When** an end customer reconfigures their template —
  adding a new option, repricing an item, or renaming a field —
  **the end customer wants to** save the whole document in one atomic action
  and see it live immediately,
  **so the vendor can** stop absorbing support hours on customer-driven
  configuration edits and customers can roll out changes same-day."
- **Commit**: `📦 CFG-823 Adopt ULID for client-side ID generation (enables atomic-save)`

**Why this wins.**
The naïve draft installs the developer as the actor and frames the benefit as
an implementation convenience — a pattern that is not merely imprecise but
actively misleading, because it trains reviewers and managers to assess the
change on technical merit alone, stripped of its business justification.
The trace-upward framing restores the correct actor (end customer), the
correct beneficiary (vendor recouping support labour), and the correct value
horizon (same-day config rollout).
A PR title and Job Story written this way survive the CFO test, survive the
sprint-review slide, and anchor future refactors to the same business outcome —
the dep bump becomes evidence in a financial argument, not a footnote in a
changelog.

### B2. Refactor: Extract Notification Dispatch

**Scenario.**
A SaaS billing platform sends order-confirmation emails through a bespoke
sender tangled into the order flow.
The roadmap adds SMS billing reminders to shorten days-sales-outstanding;
FEAT-230 (child of FEAT-225 "Multi-channel billing reminders to reduce DSO")
extracts the email sender into a shared outbox module so the SMS channel can
plug in cleanly in a later PR.
No user-visible behaviour changes in this diff.

**Naïve draft.**

```
Extract notification sender to shared infrastructure
```

Job Story: "**When** implementing SMS billing notifications,
**the developer wants to** reuse the existing notification infrastructure,
**so they can** add SMS without rebuilding retry and scheduling logic."

This naïve draft is the existing `jtbd` SKILL.md Example 5 verbatim —
the very anti-pattern this memo is designed to replace.
The actor is the developer, the benefit is avoided rework,
and the business chain is again severed at the implementation layer.

**Trace-up at a glance:**

```
♻️ Extract notification dispatch to shared outbox (FEAT-230)   ← the diff
  └─ SMS channel becomes pluggable (next PR)
       └─ Billing admins reach customers on monitored channel
            └─ Customers settle invoices faster
                 └─ Days-sales-outstanding shrinks
                      └─ Vendor cashflow + operating leverage improve
                         (less collections labour, fewer late fees)
```

**Lens application:**

- **Trace-upward**: The refactor produces a shared outbox, which makes the
  SMS channel pluggable, which lets billing admins reach customers through
  the channel they actually monitor, which shortens days-sales-outstanding,
  which improves vendor cashflow.
- **5 Whys**: Why extract? To enable SMS. Why SMS? Email reminders go unread.
  Why does that matter? Late payments accumulate. Why does late payment matter?
  Cashflow and operating leverage. Why does *that* matter? The business carries
  unnecessary receivables risk on every billing cycle.
- **Mechanism vs Outcome**: The mechanism is code extraction.
  The outcome is SMS billing reminders becoming deliverable — reducing DSO and
  the collections labour attached to it.
  The refactor is invisible to every actor except the engineer who merges the
  next PR.
- **ROI buckets**: Primary bucket is Revenue captured — faster invoice settlement
  accelerates cash inflow. Secondary is Cost saved — fewer manual collections
  calls when reminders land on the channel customers check.
  Tertiary is Retention — customers who receive timely reminders and settle
  before late fees accrue report higher satisfaction than those who receive
  escalation emails.
- **CFO "so what?" test**: "Refactor notification infra" causes the CFO to
  defer to engineering judgement — the business case is invisible.
  "Groundwork for SMS billing reminders (shorten DSO)" gives the CFO a metric
  to track and a timeline to ask about.

**Best-fit lens:**
Trace-upward is again the dominant lens because the diff ships zero
user-visible change.
Mechanism-vs-outcome framing alone is insufficient — it names the outcome
(SMS possible) but does not surface the actor or the financial stake.
Only walking the chain from refactor to outbox to channel to admin to customer
to DSO to cashflow reveals the correct Job Story protagonist and the ROI
bucket that justifies prioritising this PR over other work.

**Final drafts:**

- **PR title**: `♻️ FEAT-230 Enable multi-channel billing reminders (DSO reduction groundwork)`
- **Job Story**: "**When** a customer has an unpaid invoice nearing its due date,
  **the billing admin wants to** reach the customer through whichever channel
  they actually monitor — email, SMS, or push —
  **so the vendor can** shorten days-sales-outstanding and customers can
  settle invoices before late fees apply."
- **Commit**: `♻️ FEAT-230 Extract notification dispatch to shared outbox (multi-channel groundwork)`

**Why this wins.**
The naïve draft, which currently lives in the project's own JTBD skill as a
positive example, frames developer convenience as the terminal benefit —
a framing that would pass muster in a technical retro but fails every
business-value test.
The trace-upward draft reinstates the billing admin as actor, names DSO
reduction as the financial outcome, and positions the refactor as the first
evidence point in a multi-PR business case rather than an isolated
housekeeping task.
When this PR title appears in a sprint review, a stakeholder can connect it
to the DSO metric on the OKR dashboard; when it appears in a postmortem, an
analyst can attribute the cashflow improvement to the correct initiative —
neither outcome is possible when the title describes only what the engineer did.

### C1. Periodic Secret Rotation — Platform Overhead With No Job Story

**Scenario.**
The payments service authenticates with a third-party processor using an OAuth token stored in the secrets vault.
Security policy mandates 90-day rotation; the Q3 cycle is due.
No user-visible behavior changes.
The ticket exists solely to close the rotation window before the quarter ends.

**Naïve draft.**

```
Rotate payment-processor OAuth token
```

**Trace-up at a glance (DEAD-END is the diagnostic signal):**

```
🔒 Rotate payment-processor OAuth token (OPS-RT-Q3)   ← the diff
  └─ New credential in vault + rolling restart
       └─ ▲ Trace-upward DEAD-ENDS here ▲
          (no human beneficiary; no user-visible change)
          ↓
          Diagnostic signal: consult canonical bucket list §5
          ↓
          Match: 'Security cert / secret rotation' bucket
          ↓
          Recite rationale in PR body — no Job Story required
```

**Lens application:**

- **Trace-upward**: Rotation → vault entry changes → rolling restart of the payments service → no customer-visible effect.
  The chain terminates without reaching a human beneficiary.
  This dead-end is the diagnostic signal: when trace-upward produces no actor, consult the canonical platform overhead bucket list before forcing a Job Story.

- **5 Whys**: Why rotate? Security policy says 90 days.
  Why 90 days? A compromised token that persists undetected grows in blast radius over time.
  Why does blast radius matter? Undetected card-data exposure triggers a SOC 2 CC6.1 finding and a PCI DSS Req 8 violation, which suspends payment processing.

- **Mechanism vs. Outcome**: The mechanism is a new credential written to the vault and a rolling restart.
  The outcome is continued PCI/SOC 2 compliance posture — not an improvement, simply the absence of a degradation.
  There is no positive user experience to describe.

- **ROI buckets**: Risk avoided (undetected token compromise, regulatory breach) and Platform integrity (scheduled credential hygiene).
  The canonical bucket label is "Security cert / secret rotation."
  Revenue and efficiency buckets do not apply.

- **CFO "so what?" test**: "Rotate token" → CFO asks "is something wrong?"
  The answer is: no incident — this is the Q3 scheduled cycle per the security-cert/secret-rotation canonical bucket.
  CFO is satisfied; no further narrative is owed.

**Best-fit lens.**
The dominant lens is the canonical platform overhead bucket, not any of the five analytical lenses.
When trace-upward dead-ends and the ROI bucket is "Risk avoided / Platform integrity" with no user beneficiary, the correct move is to name the canonical bucket explicitly in the PR body rather than construct a Job Story.
The canonical recitation replaces the Job Story as the required rationale.

**Final drafts:**

- **PR title**: `🔒 OPS-RT-Q3 Rotate payment-processor OAuth token (Q3 cycle)`
- **Job Story**: **Intentionally NONE — this is canonical platform overhead per §5.
  PR body recites the bucket:** *"Rotated per the Security cert / secret rotation canonical bucket.
  Quarterly cycle ensures undetected token compromise cannot persist beyond 90 days, maintaining PCI DSS Req 8 and SOC 2 CC6.1 compliance."*
- **Commit**: `🔒 OPS-RT-Q3 Rotate payment-processor OAuth token (Q3 cycle)`

**Why this wins.**
The canonical-bucket mechanism is the doctrine's safety valve.
Without it, the rule "every artifact owes a ROI rationale" forces authors to produce pseudo-Job-Stories on routine maintenance — an over-correction that erodes trust in every artifact that follows.
With it, the recited bucket supplies the rationale honestly, and the absence of a Job Story signals exactly what it should: this work keeps the platform sound; no human experience changes.

### C2. Regulatory-Forced Retention Change — Compliance Work With a Real Beneficiary

**Scenario.**
An EU GDPR audit finds that the platform retains audit logs for 30 days.
Legal determines that GDPR Art 30 ROPA requires a minimum of 13 months for the record-of-processing-activities obligation.
The Postgres TTL on the `audit_log` table is updated from 30 to 395 days.
Three EU enterprise procurement reviews have been stalled on this exact gap.

**Naïve draft.**

```
Update audit log retention to 13 months
```

**Trace-up at a glance:**

```
🔒 Extend audit_log retention 30 → 395 days (COMP-415)   ← the diff
  └─ GDPR Art 30 ROPA compliance gap closes
       └─ EU enterprise customers' compliance officers
            see retention satisfies regulatory minimum
            └─ Customer procurement teams approve our platform
                 └─ Three EU enterprise deals unblock
                    (Revenue captured + Risk avoided, both honest)
```

**Lens application:**

- **Trace-upward**: The immediate actor is the engineering team responding to an audit finding.
  The first person outside engineering is the customer's compliance officer, whose procurement checklist now passes.
  Trace-upward does not dead-end here — it surfaces a concrete external human whose work is unblocked.

- **5 Whys**: Why change retention? An audit found a GDPR gap.
  Why does the gap matter? EU enterprise customers' procurement teams require GDPR compliance proof before approving the platform for production data.
  Why? Their own regulators audit them, making a non-compliant vendor a liability they cannot accept.

- **Mechanism vs. Outcome**: The mechanism is a TTL change in one Postgres table.
  The outcome is dual: GDPR Art 30 compliance posture is restored, and three EU enterprise procurement reviews are unblocked.
  The TTL change is invisible; the unblocked deals are not.

- **ROI buckets**: Risk avoided (regulatory fine, audit failure) and Revenue captured (EU enterprise pipeline unblocked).
  A Retention argument also applies: existing EU customers' compliance officers require this to keep the platform approved in their vendor registry.
  All three buckets are honest — none is forced.

- **CFO "so what?" test**: "Update retention" → "audit-driven?" → "Yes — GDPR Art 30 ROPA; this closes the gap blocking three EU enterprise procurement reviews."
  The CFO leans in.
  The framing is not invented; the blocked deals are a stated business fact.

**Best-fit lens.**
The ROI buckets lens dominates because both risk and revenue apply simultaneously and neither is a stretch.
The 5 Whys confirms the revenue framing is honest — the customer's compliance officer is a real actor whose procurement decision is causally connected to this change.
Trace-upward names that actor precisely, which is what separates the final Job Story from a pseudo-story.

**Final drafts:**

- **PR title**: `🔒 COMP-415 Enable GDPR-compliant audit retention (unblock EU procurement)`
- **Job Story**: "**When** an EU enterprise customer's procurement team audits our compliance posture,
  **the customer's compliance officer wants to** see audit logs retained for the regulatory minimum (13 months under GDPR Art 30 ROPA),
  **so the customer can** approve our platform for production data and we can close EU enterprise deals."
- **Commit**: `🔒 COMP-415 Extend audit_log retention to 13 months (GDPR Art 30 ROPA)`

**Why this wins.**
The actor is the customer's compliance officer — not "our engineer responding to a regulator ticket."
That distinction is not cosmetic: it forces the author to locate the real human whose work changes and to state the causal chain honestly (compliance approval → procurement unblocked → revenue).
Regulatory-forced work almost always has a downstream human beneficiary; the doctrine's insistence on naming that actor is what prevents compliance tickets from collapsing into joyless mechanism descriptions.

### D1. On-call dashboard: surfacing deploy state

**Scenario.**
An internal tooling team adds a widget to an on-call dashboard
showing deploy state across regions, the last five deploys,
deploying user, and success/failure status.
The change is purely operator-facing — no customer-visible surface
is modified.
Ticket OPS-200.

**Naïve draft.**

```
Add deploy state widget to oncall dashboard
```

**Trace-up at a glance:**

```
✨ Deploy-state widget on on-call dashboard (OPS-200)   ← the diff
  └─ On-call engineer (legitimate actor — they ARE the user)
     sees deploy state at a glance during incidents
       └─ Investigation time per incident drops
            └─ Mean Time To Restore (MTTR) shortens
                 └─ Customer-facing service downtime contracts
                      └─ SLA penalties avoided +
                         customer trust preserved under incidents
```

**Lens application:**

- **Trace-upward**: Widget → on-call sees region deploy state at a
  glance → MTTR drops → customer-facing services are restored
  faster → SLA penalties are avoided and revenue is protected
  during incidents.
  The trace stops at the on-call engineer because the on-call
  engineer *is* the user — but the beneficiary chain past them
  (customer SLA compliance, revenue continuity) must still be
  named explicitly.
- **5 Whys**: Why build the widget? On-call engineers grep CI logs
  to reconstruct deploy state manually.
  Why does that cost matter? Investigation time lengthens,
  incident duration grows.
  Why does incident duration matter? Customer impact accumulates,
  SLA thresholds are breached, and incident cost compounds per
  minute.
- **Mechanism vs Outcome**: Mechanism is a React component pulling
  from the deploy API.
  Outcome is reduced mean time to restore (MTTR) for on-call
  engineers, which contracts customer-facing downtime windows.
- **ROI buckets**: Cost saved (on-call investigation hours
  recaptured) + Risk avoided (extended incident impact and SLA
  penalty exposure) + Retention (customer trust preserved under
  incident conditions).
- **CFO "so what?" test**: "Add widget" prompts "what does that
  mean?"
  "Cut on-call MTTR by giving the on-call team instant deploy
  visibility across regions" prompts "MTTR is a board-level
  incident metric — how much exposure does this cover?"
  The conversation can now be quantified.

**Best-fit lens.**
Trace-upward, with an important legitimacy caveat.
In B1 and B2, the engineer appears as actor despite the real
beneficiary being elsewhere; that substitution obscures the
outcome.
Here the on-call engineer *is* the direct user of the artifact —
the dashboard ships operator value as the change itself.
Trace-upward still applies because the justification is not
"the engineer did a thing" but "this reduces MTTR, which protects
customer SLA commitments."

**Final drafts:**

- **PR title**: `✨ OPS-200 Enable instant deploy-state visibility for on-call team`
- **Job Story**: "**When** the on-call engineer is investigating a
  customer-facing incident, **the on-call engineer wants to** see
  current deploy state across regions at a glance, **so the
  on-call engineer can** reduce MTTR and limit customer impact
  during incidents."
- **Commit**: `✨ OPS-200 Surface deploy state on on-call dashboard (MTTR reduction)`

**Why this wins.**
Unlike B1 and B2, the engineer-as-actor is not a shortcut around
naming the end beneficiary — the on-call engineer genuinely is the
user of this artifact.
But the Job Story still names the downstream chain (customer
impact, MTTR, SLA) because "engineer used a tool" is never the
full story: the instrument must justify itself through what it
protects or enables further down the value chain.
The phrase "MTTR reduction" in the commit title converts an
opaque infrastructure action into a measurable operational outcome
any stakeholder can audit.

### D2. CI pipeline parallelisation: cutting PR-to-merge from 12 to 4 minutes

**Scenario.**
The infrastructure team parallelises test suites across additional
CI runners.
Average PR-to-merge wall-clock time drops from 12 minutes to
4 minutes.
The change is internal — no customer-visible feature ships — but
the throughput gain propagates to every subsequent delivery.
Ticket INFRA-89.

**Naïve draft.**

```
Parallelize CI test suites
```

**Trace-up at a glance:**

```
⚡ Parallelize CI test suites (INFRA-89)             ← the diff
  └─ Developer (legitimate actor — they ARE the user)
     receives CI feedback in <5 min instead of 12 min
       └─ Engineering team throughput rises ~15%
            └─ Feature delivery rate accelerates
                 └─ Customer requests answered in days, not weeks
                      └─ Competitive response time improves
                         (DORA lead-time → org performance,
                         Forsgren et al. 2018)
```

**Lens application:**

- **Trace-upward**: CI speedup → faster review cycle → more
  PRs merged per day → features land sooner → customer-visible
  improvements arrive earlier → competitive position and revenue
  velocity both improve.
  The developer is legitimately the direct beneficiary of the
  faster loop, but the chain does not terminate there.
- **5 Whys**: Why parallelise? PR-to-merge takes 12 minutes, which
  fragments developer concentration.
  Why does fragmentation matter? Context-switch cost accumulates
  and queuing delays stack across the team.
  Why does team-level throughput matter? Feature delivery slows,
  customer requests wait longer, competitive response time
  degrades.
- **Mechanism vs Outcome**: Mechanism is a parallel test runner
  configuration.
  Outcome is engineering throughput increase, translating to
  faster customer-feature delivery — a direct DORA lead-time
  improvement (Forsgren et al. 2018).
- **ROI buckets**: Time-to-value (features reach customers faster)
  + Cost saved (engineer idle time eliminated across every PR,
  every day).
  Forsgren et al. (2018) establish empirically that deployment
  frequency and lead time predict organisational performance,
  anchoring these buckets to published evidence.
- **CFO "so what?" test**: "Parallelize CI" → "what does that
  mean for the business?"
  "Cut PR-to-merge from 12 to 4 minutes — engineering throughput
  rises measurably, every sprint."
  That framing produces a number the finance organisation can
  attach to headcount efficiency models.

**Best-fit lens.**
ROI buckets combined with 5 Whys.
The developer is the immediate beneficiary — faster CI directly
serves their workflow — so engineer-as-actor is defensible here.
But "developer wants fast CI" in isolation is still a mechanism
statement.
The 5 Whys chain exposes the downstream link: developer throughput
→ feature delivery rate → customer-facing value → business
performance.
ROI buckets then give the CFO a framework: Time-to-value and Cost
saved are both measurable and auditable without speculation.

**Final drafts:**

- **PR title**: `⚡ INFRA-89 Cut PR-to-merge time from 12 → 4 min (CI parallelisation)`
- **Job Story**: "**When** a developer pushes a PR for review,
  **the developer wants** CI to complete in under 5 minutes,
  **so the engineering team can** ship features faster and the
  company can respond to customer requests within days rather
  than weeks."
- **Commit**: `⚡ INFRA-89 Parallelize CI test suites (cut PR-to-merge 12m → 4m)`

**Why this wins.**
As in D1, the engineer-as-actor is legitimate — developers are
the direct users of CI feedback loops.
But the Job Story does not stop there: it names the delivery chain
(engineering team throughput, company response time to customers)
because the justification for the investment lives at the
organisational level, not at the individual developer's preference.
The concrete metric in the commit title (12m → 4m) gives every
reviewer, future archaeologist, and finance stakeholder an
immediate, falsifiable claim — a standard neither the naïve draft
nor a generic "improve CI performance" formulation can meet.

### ROI bucket coverage across the eight examples

| Bucket | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Revenue | A1 (primary), B1 (secondary), B2 (primary), C2 (primary), D2 (org-level) |
| Cost | A1 (secondary), A2 (secondary), B1 (primary), B2 (secondary), D1 (primary), D2 (primary) |
| Retention | A2 (secondary), B1 (tertiary), B2 (tertiary), C2 (secondary), D1 (tertiary) |
| Time-to-value | B1 (secondary), B2 (implicit), D2 (primary) |
| Risk | A2 (primary), C1 (primary), C2 (primary), D1 (secondary) |
| Platform integrity | C1 (canonical bucket) |

Every bucket from §3.4 appears in at least one worked example, satisfying the
coverage requirement. The Platform integrity bucket appears uniquely in C1,
because by construction it is the only category that requires the canonical
overhead exception rather than a full Job Story.

## §7 — Anti-patterns: the bureaucracy drift catalogue

The doctrine stated in §2 is a rule, not a self-enforcing mechanism.
In practice, teams drift toward paths of least resistance:
the humility signal of "just a…", the lazy invocation of a canonical
bucket, the Job Story written to satisfy a linter rather than to
communicate.
This catalogue names ten specific drift patterns observed in the wild,
the social mechanism by which each slips past review, and the precise
corrective move.
Reviewers and authors alike should treat this table as a standing
checklist, not a historical record.

| Anti-pattern | How it slips past | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "This is just a…" dismissal | Sounds humble; reviewers are socially conditioned not to push back on humility signals, so the minimisation goes unchallenged | Apply the 5 Whys lens (§3.2); terminate only on a business answer. If the chain terminates on "it's just a thing," the work does not ship as-is — either earn a real story or escalate to the canonical-bucket exception (§5). Note: the 5 Whys lens is used here prescriptively; (Card 2017) documents its limits when applied carelessly. |
| "Platform overhead" used as default | The canonical-bucket exception exists and is documented in §5; lazy authors invoke it without matching to a specific named entry | Require the author to name the specific canonical-bucket entry AND recite its one-line rationale verbatim. Audit invocations periodically (§8, "platform overhead claim audit" row). |
| Citing canonical rationale without understanding it | Parroting; the recitation muscle is exercised and the review check is satisfied, but the connection between work and rationale is not internalised | Apply the annual canonical-bucket review (§8): does the rationale still hold? Has the cost of maintaining the bucket grown beyond its value? If the team cannot defend the rationale in a five-minute conversation, the bucket is a candidate for retirement. |
| Pseudo-business value | "Better separation of concerns" or "improved maintainability" sounds business-adjacent but is a technical statement with no named actor and no named outcome | The CFO test (§3.5) catches these on a first pass: a CFO handed the title would ask "so what?" and receive no useful answer. Reference: (Klement 2013) for the original pseudo-business-value warning; (Wake 2003) INVEST "Valuable" criterion as the minimal bar the pseudo-statement fails. |
| Developer as actor for plumbing PRs | The GH-276 case: the developer is the proximate author and reviewer, so naming the developer as actor feels correct and goes unchallenged | Apply trace-upward (§3.1): walk the dependency graph from the diff outward until the chain reaches a named non-engineer. Engineer-as-actor is legitimate only when the engineer IS the user — the change ships operator value as its primary outcome (see §6 D1, D2). |
| Stacking ROI buckets to inflate | "Revenue AND retention AND risk avoided" sounds more significant than any single bucket, and reviewers rarely object to broader claimed value | Pick one primary bucket; other buckets are secondary and may be mentioned in the PR body but must not lead. Stacking inflates the apparent outcome, obscures the actual primary driver, and makes the §8 quarterly audit impossible to calibrate. |
| Over-correction: forcing a Job Story onto true overhead | A misreading of the doctrine. Authors who have absorbed §2 but not §5 attempt to write a Job Story for cert rotation, producing exactly the pseudo-business value the memo argues against | §6 C1 demonstrates the canonical-bucket pattern as the correct path. The doctrine explicitly allows the canonical exception; forcing a Job Story onto scheduled credential rotation does not honour the exception — it violates it. |
| Treating Job Stories as ticket-summary boilerplate | The author writes the story to satisfy a lint check or a review convention, not to communicate; the result passes structural inspection while failing the CFO test | Require the story to pass the CFO test (§3.5) as a review criterion independent of structural lint. Code review should challenge stories that are syntactically valid but semantically hollow. |
| "Refactor" as a goal in itself | A refactor is shipped without a stated downstream feature; the description reads as an engineering objective with no payback plan, and reviewers approve it as "cleaning up technical debt" | Apply the bundle-or-hold rule: if the refactor has no downstream feature pending, hold the branch and ship it with the next feature it directly unblocks. The commit title then names the downstream outcome (see §6 B2). |
| Inflating scope to justify ROI | The author adds scope to a PR so the outcome story sounds larger; "Enable multi-channel notifications" is used to justify a PR that ships only an internal dispatch refactor | Atomic commit and PR discipline: one logical change per PR. If the ROI story requires scope that is not present in the diff, split into a sequence of named PRs, each with its own bucket assignment and its own story. The dep-bump example (§6 B1) demonstrates how a single-layer change earns a real story without inflating its scope. |

Each anti-pattern in this catalogue is a path of least resistance.
The doctrine's enforcement work is precisely the work of naming these
paths in code review and refusing to let them pass unnamed.
"Sounds humble" is a social pressure; naming it as a drift pattern
neutralises the pressure by making it visible.
"Passes lint" is a structural check; the CFO test is the semantic
check that lint cannot replace.
Neither the doctrine nor the linter is sufficient without reviewers
who know the catalogue.

The catalogue is not exhaustive.
New anti-patterns will surface as the doctrine is applied to
unfamiliar change types, new team structures, and edge cases not
covered by the eight worked examples in §6.
The §8 quarterly artifact audit is the discovery mechanism: when an
artifact fails the CFO test in a way not explained by any row in this
table, that failure is evidence of a new anti-pattern.
Authors and reviewers are expected to propose additions via the ADR
process referenced in §5, keeping the catalogue live rather than
treating it as a closed list.

The practice of naming engineering anti-patterns has a long precedent.
(Cunningham 1992) coined "technical debt" as a deliberate financial
metaphor precisely to make a class of unnamed engineering decisions
legible to stakeholders who could not otherwise see the accumulating
cost.
(Fowler 2003) extended the taxonomy by distinguishing deliberate from
inadvertent debt: deliberate debt is a conscious trade-off; inadvertent
debt is accumulated without awareness that a trade-off is being made.
Most bureaucracy drift is inadvertent in exactly Fowler's sense —
authors who write developer-as-actor stories or invoke the platform
overhead bucket without recitation are not choosing to obscure value;
they are following the path of least resistance without recognising it
as a choice.
Naming the anti-pattern is the act that converts inadvertent drift into
a deliberate, refusable option.

## §8 — Using this memo as a reflection tool

The memo as upfront guidance is half its value.
The other half is as a reflection instrument —
a doctrine to audit existing PR titles, Job Stories,
and commits against, periodically, to surface drift before it
becomes culture.
Upfront guidance shapes new work;
retrospective audits correct the work that slipped past it.
Without a renewal mechanism, any published doctrine degrades into
a document people cite but do not apply
(Samuelson & Zeckhauser 1988).

Four periodic practices operationalise this renewal.
Each practice has a documented cadence, owner, output format,
and escalation threshold.
Together they satisfy Goal-Question-Metric discipline
(Basili & Weiss 1984): the goal is sustained ROI-framing literacy;
the questions are "how many artifacts pass the CFO test?" and
"are canonical buckets still load-bearing?";
the metrics are failure rates and stakeholder comprehension scores.
These four practices keep the doctrine alive past its publication date.

| Practice | Cadence | Owner | Output | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quarterly artifact audit | Quarterly | Engineering manager | Retro note | >30% fail CFO test → leadership |
| Canonical bucket audit | Annual | EM + on-call lead | ADR | Bucket can't survive review → retire |
| "Platform overhead" claim audit | Per-release | On-call lead | Linear ticket | Many fail recitation → doctrine erosion |
| Stakeholder excitement check | Quarterly | PM | Retro note | Non-eng dismiss >50% titles → revise lenses |

### Practice 1: Quarterly artifact audit

The quarterly artifact audit measures how well the doctrine is
being applied across a random sample of recent engineering work.

The engineering manager samples 20 PRs at random from the
preceding quarter.
For each PR, the auditor scores three dimensions against the
five lenses from §3: which lens would have produced the best draft
of the title and Job Story; whether the actual artifact used that
lens; and whether the artifact passes the CFO test when read aloud.
The three scores are aggregated to produce a per-lens failure rate
and an overall CFO-test pass rate for the quarter.
The scoring process is deliberately manual — automated lint can
catch structural absence but cannot detect pseudo-business value
(Forsgren et al. 2021).

The output is a retro note posted in the engineering channel.
The note includes: the per-lens score table, three to five
quoted examples of strong artifacts, three to five quoted
examples of weak artifacts with the specific failure mode named,
and a one-paragraph drift summary comparing this quarter's
pass rate to the previous one.

Escalation triggers when more than 30 percent of audited PRs
fail the CFO test.
At that threshold, the doctrine is being applied as a performative
ritual — titles are outcome-shaped but do not name a real business
outcome — and the pattern requires leadership attention,
not a team retrospective.

### Practice 2: Canonical bucket audit

The annual canonical bucket audit asks whether the §5 exceptions
table still earns its authority to waive the default ROI rule.

Once per year, the engineering manager and the on-call lead
convene to review each entry in the canonical-bucket table.
For each bucket, the review asks four questions:
Does the canonical rationale still hold given current architecture
and regulatory posture?
Has the compliance cost of maintaining this bucket grown beyond its
original value?
Has the recurrence cadence shifted in ways that make the one-line
rationale misleading?
Has the bucket become a catch-all for work that does not satisfy
its stated scope?
The method is structured conversation, not automated tooling;
the act of speaking the rationale aloud surfaces decay that reading
does not (Allspaw 2012).

The output is an Architecture Decision Record documenting the
review outcome for each bucket:
retain unchanged, restructure with amended rationale and recurrence,
or retire.
A retired bucket does not leave a gap — work that previously
fell under it must justify itself under the §2 default rule going
forward, which is the correct incentive.

Escalation occurs when a bucket cannot survive the four-question
review.
Retirement is the escalation; there is no further review path for
a bucket that has lost its rationale.

### Practice 3: "Platform overhead" claim audit

The per-release overhead claim audit enforces the §2 hard edge —
invoking the canonical-bucket exception requires matching a specific
bucket by name and being able to recite its rationale.

After each release, the on-call lead samples the release's PRs
that claimed canonical platform overhead.
For each claim, the auditor checks two conditions:
Does the PR body name a specific canonical bucket from §5 by its
exact label, rather than using the generic phrase "platform
overhead"?
If the PR author were asked in a post-release retrospective to
recite that bucket's one-line canonical rationale, could they do so
without looking it up?
The recitation test is a proxy for comprehension;
rote citation without comprehension is the cargo-cult failure mode
(Feynman 1974).

The output is a Linear ticket for each PR that failed either check.
The corrective action is one of two things: rewrite the PR
description to name the specific bucket and quote its rationale, or
escalate to add a new canonical bucket if the work is genuinely
novel overhead that §5 does not yet cover.

Escalation triggers when a statistically significant share of
release PRs fail the recitation test across two consecutive releases.
At that point, the doctrine is being eroded by rote adoption;
the pattern belongs on the agenda of the next team retrospective,
not just a set of individual Linear tickets.

### Practice 4: Stakeholder excitement check

The quarterly stakeholder excitement check provides external
calibration against the CFO test by substituting a real
non-engineer for the imagined one.

Once per quarter, the PM recruits one non-engineer —
a sales engineer, account executive, or customer success
representative — and presents them with ten recent PR titles
and their Job Stories.
The non-engineer is asked three questions per artifact:
Does this excite you?
Does it leave you cold?
Does it confuse you?
The responses serve as ground truth for the CFO test;
they reveal whether outcome-framed language is actually
communicating outcomes to the audience that must act on them,
or merely satisfying the form of outcome language (Petty,
Cacioppo & Schumann 1983).
Construal-level theory predicts that stakeholders evaluating
strategic investment operate at high construal and will respond
most favourably to artifacts framed at the outcome level
rather than the mechanism level (Trope & Liberman 2010).

The output is a retro note summarising the non-engineer's
responses: a ranked list of artifacts from most to least exciting,
paired quotations of stakeholder-exciting versus
stakeholder-boring artifacts, and a one-paragraph analysis of
which lens failure modes produced the cold or confusing artifacts.

Escalation triggers when non-engineers dismiss more than 50 percent
of the presented titles as either cold or confusing.
At that threshold, the lenses themselves may require revision —
engineers may be writing stories that satisfy internal
JTBD review criteria while failing to communicate to the
audience the doctrine was designed to serve.
The PM brings the retro note and the paired artifact examples
to the next quarterly planning session as input to a doctrine
revision discussion.

---

Section 9 names the skills that will eventually automate parts
of these practices.
In particular, `Dev10x:project-audit` is the candidate vehicle for
Practice 1: given a repository and a date range, the skill samples
N recent PRs, scores each against the five lenses and the CFO test,
and produces the retro-note artifact without requiring the
engineering manager to conduct the sampling and scoring manually.
The quarterly audit cadence and the escalation thresholds documented
here serve as the acceptance criteria for that automation.

## §9 — How this drives the skills

This memo is doctrine, not implementation.
The seven skill changes enumerated below are separate follow-up PRs;
each will cite this document as its doctrine root so the rationale
does not have to be re-litigated inside a 200-line SKILL.md.
The memo travels faster and further than any skill can —
it is the shared reference that keeps disparate PRs coherent.

| Skill / reference | Change after this memo lands |
|---|---|
| `references/git-jtbd.md` | Add link to this memo as doctrine root; update Job Story examples to trace-upward style; replace user-story-style examples with Job Stories tied to ROI buckets. |
| `skills/jtbd/SKILL.md` | GH-276 patch: add Business ROI First section, integrate the five lenses, rewrite Example 5 (using B2 from this memo), add the new B1 dep-bump example, fix the Subject Selection table (remove "Developer" as actor for plumbing rows), extend the anti-pattern table with §7 rows. |
| `skills/git-commit/` | Add commit-title validation: leading verb should be outcome-focused ("Enable") not implementation-focused ("Add"). Reject commits whose subject would fail the CFO test. |
| `skills/gh-pr-create/` | Add a doctrine link in the PR template; require the author to pick a ROI bucket (or canonical overhead bucket) at PR creation time; surface the lens prompts during the JTBD step. |
| `skills/ticket-scope/` | Apply lenses during scoping. The scoping doc should declare its target bucket alongside the JTBD section. |
| `skills/release-notes/` | Bucket releases by ROI when generating notes; surface canonical platform overhead separately (e.g., "Platform maintenance: 3 PRs, all under the Security cert/secret rotation bucket"). |
| `skills/project-audit/` | Add a reflection-tool mode that runs the §8 quarterly artifact audit automatically across N recent PRs. |

The memo, the skills, and the audit work as a system.
The §3 lenses give engineers the vocabulary to articulate ROI;
the §5 canonical-bucket mechanism gives them a principled escape valve;
the §7 anti-pattern catalogue names the failure modes so reviewers
can cite them by name rather than re-arguing them per PR.
Without skills that encode these tools into enforced workflow steps,
the memo remains optional reading — consulted once, forgotten by the
next sprint.

The §8 reflection practices close the feedback loop.
A quarterly artifact audit surfaces whether the lenses are being
applied honestly or are being gamed into new forms of pseudo-value.
An annual canonical-bucket audit prevents the §5 exception from
quietly expanding until it swallows the rule.
Neither the skills nor the memo can self-correct without the audit
returning signal to the team that commissioned them.

**Spawned follow-up — `Dev10x:knowledge-research` (NOT in scope for
this PR).**
The §10 bibliography was assembled using a parallel-research-agents
pattern: 9 subagent dispatches across 3 sequential rounds, each
focused on a thematic cluster (JTBD theory, lean canon, behavioural
economics, commit-message research, etc.), each operating under a
uniform reference-format spec and Sonnet model tier per
`.claude/rules/model-selection.md`.
The result was ~77 primary sources returned in a single structured
pass, with deduplication and thematic organisation handled by a
synthesis agent in the final round.
This capability — scoped literature research via parallel agents with
a shared format contract — is itself a reusable pattern worth
encapsulating as a skill.
Tentative name: `Dev10x:knowledge-research`.
This is the only section of the memo that documents the
meta-process by which the memo itself was produced.
A separate ticket and PR will scope and implement the skill after
this memo lands; it is explicitly out of scope here.

ISBN 978-0-470-09463-1. — **Cranfield's IS/IT benefits taxonomy (financial / quantifiable / intangible) is the closest published analogue to the memo's six buckets.** Cost Saved and Revenue → financial; Risk Avoided → risk/compliance; Platform Integrity → strategic positioning; Retention + Time-to-Value → quantifiable/productivity. **Primary grounding for §3.4 non-arbitrariness claim.**

### §10.13 — Non-Western canon: Japanese Lean lineage and cross-cultural perspectives

- **Toyoda, Sakichi (c. 1902–1910s).** *Records of the Automatic Loom Invention and the Self-Stop Mechanism* (自動機織機の発明と自己停止機構に関する記録, Jidōhata no Hatsumei to Jiko Teishi Kiko ni Kansuru Kiroku). Internal Toyota Group archives; excerpts in Toyoda Eiji 1987. — Original source for *jidoka* (autonomation): a machine should stop and signal when it detects a defect rather than pass bad work downstream.

English ed.: Asian Productivity Organization. ISBN 978-92-833-1083-1. — Loss Function: quality is not binary but a continuous deviation from target that accumulates cost downstream. Applied to commits: every degree of ambiguity in a title is a loss function on stakeholder attention and review accuracy, not a zero-cost gap.
- **Toyoda, E. (1987).** *Toyota: Fifty Years in Motion — An Autobiography by the Chairman*. Kodansha International. ISBN 978-4-7700-1349-3. — First-person account of building TPS alongside Ohno; the "why" of a process change always preceded its technical specification in TPS culture.
