## Name Format

MCP tools follow a consistent naming convention from Python function to MCP
registration:

- **Python function**: `snake_case` (e.g., `detect_tracker`)
- **MCP registration**: `mcp__plugin_<PluginName>_<ServerName>__<snake_case>`
  - `<PluginName>`: Title-case plugin name from plugin.json (e.g., `Dev10x`)
  - `<ServerName>`: Server name in plugin.json (e.g., `cli`, `db`)
  - `<snake_case>`: Unchanged function name

## Examples

| Server | Function | MCP Name |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `cli` | `detect_tracker()` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker` |
| `cli` | `pr_comments()` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_comments` |
| `cli` | `pr_comment_reply()` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_comment_reply` |
| `cli` | `get_commit_log()` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__get_commit_log` |
| `cli` | `mktmp()` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp` |
| `db` | `list_tables()` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_db__list_tables` |

## Tool Declaration Pattern

All MCP tools follow a two-layer pattern: internal functions return a
typed `Result[T]` (`SuccessResult` or `ErrorResult` from
`dev10x.domain.common.result`), and the `@server.tool()` handler at the
MCP boundary routes the result through `to_wire()` — which asserts
`isinstance(result, ResultProtocol)` then calls `.to_dict()` — to
produce the wire-format dict (ADR-0009).

```python
# Internal module (audit/release/monitor/permission/plan/skill_index/
# utilities/github/db): public functions return Result[T].
from dev10x.domain.common.result import Result, err, ok

async def collect_prs(...) -> Result[dict[str, Any]]:
    if error_occurs:
        return err("descriptive message")
    return ok({tool-specific fields})

# MCP server boundary (src/dev10x/mcp/server_cli.py): route through
# to_wire() so external consumers see the uniform wire format and a
# handler that forgot to return a Result fails loud at the boundary.
from dev10x.domain.common.result import to_wire

@server.tool()
async def collect_prs(...) -> dict:
    """Brief description of what the tool does."""
    return to_wire(await rel.collect_prs(...))
```

**Wire format** (what callers see):
- `SuccessResult.to_dict()` → `{tool-specific fields}` (no `success` flag
  is added automatically — keep success payloads tool-specific).
- `ErrorResult.to_dict()` → `{"error": "descriptive message", ...}`
  (extra metadata like `messages`/`errors` is preserved).

**Why two layers**: internal callers branch on `isinstance(result,
SuccessResult)` for type-safe error handling; the MCP boundary keeps
the legacy dict shape so existing tool consumers don't break. New
modules MUST mirror the pattern — return `Result[T]` internally, route
through `to_wire()` at the `@server.tool()` boundary.

**Tool-specific success payloads**:
- `mktmp`: returns `{"path": "/tmp/file"}`
- Some tools return `{"success": True, "data": result}`
- Some tools return only tool-specific fields without a `success` flag
- `push_safe`: returns `{"pushed": true, "ref": "...", "remote":
  "...", "sha": "...", "tracking": "...", "ci_run_url": null}` on a
  successful push (GH-188). On a blocked or failed push, `pushed` is
  `false` and `blocked_reason` names the cause. Only `{"error": ...}`
  signals an MCP-level failure. Older callers that treat any non-error
  payload as success continue to work.

Callers must know each tool's specific success response format. Branch
on the presence of an `"error"` key, never on whether the dict is
empty.

### Concurrency conventions for new tools (GH-827, ADR-0011)

MCP tools run in a long-lived daemon and are hit concurrently by
parallel worktrees and agents. When a new tool (or the domain module
behind it) touches shared state, it MUST follow the write-safety model:

- **New shared-state file** — a JSON/YAML store or log under
  `~/.config/Dev10x/`, a repo's `.claude/`, or a home cache — routes
  through `dev10x.domain.file_locks`, never a bare `Path.write_text` /
  `open(…, "w"|"a")`: `locked_json_update` / `locked_yaml_update` for a
  read-modify-write cycle (or `file_lock` wrapping a typed load/save
  when the store deserializes to a dataclass), `atomic_write_text` for
  a full overwrite, `atomic_append_line` for an append. An unlocked
  load→mutate→save is a lost-update race; a bare `write_text` truncates
  on crash. Two writers on the SAME file must lock on the same sidecar
  — `file_lock` appends `.lock` to the full name while
  `locked_json_update` replaces the suffix, so mixing them on one path
  silently fails to exclude.
- **New subprocess call** passes `timeout=` (in-package code via
  `subprocess_utils`, which bounds it; standalone uv-scripts via a
  local `_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` constant since they cannot import
  `dev10x`).

### A write is a request, not a receipt (GH-1099)

The MCP transport can drop mid-call and lose a **state-changing** call
with no error payload — a field-observed `update_pr` never landed and
returned nothing to say so. No `ErrorResult` is possible in that case,
and the caller cannot tell it apart from a call that returned nothing;
`skills/foreman/references/mcp-connectivity.md` has the full argument.

So callers must not treat a write wrapper's return as proof of effect.
After `update_pr`, `create_pr`, `pr_ready`, `push_safe`, `pr_labels`,
`issue_*`, or `merge_pr`, re-read the specific field that was set —
`pr_get` for a body or `isDraft`, the remote SHA for a push, `state`
for an issue close — rather than checking only that the object exists.
The branch-on-`"error"` rule above still holds; it just does not cover
the case where nothing comes back at all. Dev10x owns no keepalive on
that hop and cannot add one, so reconnect-on-demand is not
implementable in this repo (GH-1072).

The `reviewer-generic` checklist enforces both on `**/*.py` changes.

## Canonical Parameter Shapes

Parameter naming is not uniform across tools, which defeats agent
first-call inference (GH-462 F4 — 7 first-call validation errors in
one session). Use these shapes verbatim:

| Tool | Required parameters | Common wrong guess |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|
| `issue_get` | `number` | `issue_id` |
| `pr_get` | `number` | `pr_number` |
| `pr_comments` | `pr_number`, `action` (no default) | omitting `action` |
| `unresolved_threads` | `repo` (no CWD default); pass `pr_number` for a single PR | omitting `repo`; omitting `pr_number` for a per-PR check |
| `check_top_level_comments` | `repo` (no CWD default), `pr_number` | omitting either; expecting `unresolved_threads`'s sweep-all-PRs mode — this tool has none (GH-1285) |
| `push_safe` | `args` list, e.g. `["-u", "origin", "<branch>"]` | bare call; passing `protected_branches=[]` expecting protection off — an empty list reads as "no override" (GH-1031) |
| `resolve_review_thread` | `thread_ids` (list) | singular `thread_id` |
| `resolve_gate` | `gate` (toggle name); optional `context` dict of gate facts | passing preset/friction values — the tool reads session policy itself (ADR-0016 D-2); passing `human_review` on `gate="merge"` — durable policy, read unconditionally and echoed back in `ignored_context_fields` (GH-1000) |
| `pr_close` | `pr_number` | `number` (that's `issue_close`'s param name) |
| `resolve_plugin_origin` | `skill_paths` (list of absolute paths) | singular `skill_path` |
| `pin_gate_preset` | `preset`; optional `scope` (`repo` default / `repo-only` / `dir`) | passing a `match` or a path — the tool derives the repo stem itself; passing `gate_overrides={"supervisor_review": ...}` — it is not a per-gate toggle (absent from `_ENUM_TOGGLES`), use `pin_supervisor_review` instead (GH-1165) |
| `supervisor_review_status` | none (optional `cwd`) | reading `friction.yaml` directly instead — the tool owns the precedence; the deprecated `human_review_status` name still answers for one release (ADR-0022 D-2) |
| `pin_supervisor_review` | `supervisor_review` (`required`/`none`); optional `scope` (`repo` default / `repo-only` / `dir`) | reaching for `pin_gate_preset`'s `gate_overrides` — `supervisor_review` is a project-wide fact, not a gate toggle (GH-1165) |
| `tracker_status` | none (optional `cwd`) | treating `pinned: false` as "no tracker" — it still reports a resolved `tracker` (the default) |
| `pin_tracker` | `tracker` (`linear`/`jira`/`github`); optional `scope` | passing `gitlab`/`clickup` — not in v1 scope, and an unknown value errors rather than defaulting |
| `ide_status` | none (optional `cwd`) | reading a resolved `none` as "unanswered" — most checkouts genuinely run no IDE server, so `none` is an answer; `pinned` is the unanswered flag |
| `pin_ide` | `ide` (`pycharm`/`none`); optional `scope` | passing `vscode`/`intellij` — not in v1 scope, and an unknown value errors rather than defaulting |
| `task_index_append` | `entry` dict with required `subject` + `source` | reading the store and writing it back by hand — the tool owns the locked read-append-write |
| `pr_labels` | `pr_number`; `action` (`list` default / `add` / `remove`), plus `labels` for the two writes | separate `pr_label_add` / `pr_label_remove` names — it is one tool with an action selector, like `pr_comments` |
| `issue_labels` | `number`; `action` (`list` default / `add` / `remove`), plus `labels` for the two writes | `issue_edit(labels=...)` for anything but adding — that parameter's docstring used to claim replacement semantics it never had (GH-1322); `pr_number` (that's `pr_labels`'s param name) |
| `task_index_get` | none (optional `cwd`) | `Read`ing `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml` — retired by ADR-0018 D5; the tool probes it as a fallback |
| `pr_ready` | `pr_number`; optional `undo` (bool) | assuming it only publishes — `undo=true` returns a PR to draft |
| `ci_check_status` | `pr_number`, `repo`; optional `wait`, `wait_out_pending` (default `true`), `wait_for` (list of check names) | reading a `wait=true` `failing` as "every leg finished" — check `pending` (GH-1065); expecting `wait_out_pending` to cover a failed REQUIRED leg — it does not, use `wait_for` (GH-1138); raising `max_polls` to cover a slow PR — the grant is capped by the transport budget, so ask twice rather than once for longer (GH-1288) |
| `create_pr` | `title`, `issue_id`, plus either `job_story` or `body`; optional `head`, `milestone`, `repo` | passing a long `job_story` and expecting the extra paragraphs to survive — only `body` is used verbatim (GH-1073); assuming `repo` is rejected — it is accepted since GH-1269 |
| `merge_pr` | `pr_number`; optional `expected_head_sha`, `use_bot` | omitting `expected_head_sha` after a pre-merge gate read `headRefOid` — the merge then takes whatever the head is *now* (GH-1267); reading `merged_as` as a request rather than a result — it reports which identity actually merged (GH-1272) |
| `update_pr` | `pr_number`, plus at least one of `body` / `title` / `base_branch` / `milestone` | `gh pr edit --milestone` — routed here (GH-1098) |

Behavioral caveats:

- The `task_index_*` trio is the park family's only sanctioned write
  path (GH-1009, ADR-0018 D5). The store lives at
  `~/.config/Dev10x/task-index/<repo-stem>.yaml`, keyed by the git
  **common dir**, so one index serves a repo and every worktree of it.
  Reaching the file with `Write`/`Edit` — at the new path or the retired
  `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml` — is a defect twice over: under a repo's
  `.claude/` it trips the self-settings consent gate that no allow rule
  suppresses, and anywhere it bypasses the file lock, so two parallel
  worktrees parking at once lose an entry. `task_index_get` reads the
  retired path as a fallback for one release (`legacy_read: true`), and
  the next append folds it forward (`folded_legacy`).

- `pr_labels` carries the durable `review:cleared` signal (GH-1008).
  `Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review` reads it before the stand-by clearance
  gate and skips asking when present; the two "I reviewed it" answers
  write it. Because a sign-off covers the commits that were read,
  `Dev10x:git-groom` removes it after a force-push — a clearance must
  not survive the rewrite that invalidated it. Both writes are
  idempotent (`add` skips present labels, `remove` intersects against
  the current set first, so clearing an unset label is a no-op rather
  than a 404), so call them unconditionally instead of probing.

- `issue_labels` is `pr_labels`'s issue-side counterpart (GH-1322),
  with the same idempotence contract. `issue_edit`'s `labels`
  parameter is additive-only — it calls `gh issue edit --add-label`,
  which never removes or replaces — so its docstring no longer claims
  "replacement label list" semantics. Use `issue_labels(action=
  "remove", ...)` to remove a label and `issue_labels(action="list",
  ...)` to read the current set; `issue_edit` still owns title, body,
  and milestone writes.

- `pr_ready` flips a PR in both directions: omit `undo` to publish a
  draft, pass `undo=true` to convert a published PR back to draft
  (GH-931). Raw `gh pr ready --undo` is hook-blocked like every other
  form, so this parameter is the only sanctioned way to un-publish —
  which is the *safe* direction when a problem surfaces after marking
  ready. The success payload carries `draft` reflecting the new state.

- `pr_ready` must be re-run after ANY force-push (GH-958). A
  `--force-with-lease` push resets a published PR back to draft, so a
  ready call that succeeded earlier — including a
  `create_pr(draft=false)` — does not survive a later rebase, amend, or
  groom. Call `pr_ready` after the FINAL push and confirm with a fresh
  `pr_get` that `isDraft` is `false`; otherwise `merge_pr` fails with
  `GraphQL: Pull Request is still a draft`, and the re-ready costs
  another bot-CI round.

- `create_pr` rejects a `job_story` missing any of `**When**` /
  `**<actor> wants**` / `**so <beneficiary> can**` with an
  actionable error before the PR is opened, and `update_pr` moves any
  content trailing the `Fixes:` line above it (GH-945) — so neither
  path can emit a body that trips the hygiene bot.

- `create_pr` always emits at least one `Fixes:` reference (GH-1256).
  The trailer used to be derived from `fixes_url` alone, so linking an
  issue the documented way — `issue_id` — produced a body with no
  trailer, which the hygiene bot rejects. `issue_id` now seeds the
  reference and every `closes=` member is added alongside it, because
  `Closes #N` never fires on a merge to `develop` (GH-958). An explicit
  `fixes_url` still leads, and prose such as `none — self-motivated`
  passes through untouched.

- `create_pr` now reads the created body back and refuses a PR whose
  body carries no `Fixes:` trailer (GH-1274). Deriving a reference was
  never proof one arrived, and a write is a request, not a receipt — so
  the check is a fresh `pr_get`, not a local assertion. The refusal
  names the PR number and URL, because the PR is already open at that
  point and an error that does not identify it strands it; repair the
  body with `update_pr` rather than opening a second PR. A successful
  call carries `fixes_trailer_verified: true`. When the read-back
  itself fails the call still succeeds, with
  `fixes_trailer_verified: false` and a `warning` — an unreadable
  verification is not evidence of a bad body.

- **The trailer closes issues unreliably on a merge to `develop`**
  (GH-1274). One merge closed two of three identical trailers, a later
  session recorded 0 of 7 across two merges, and a third closed two of
  three; both the full-URL and bare-`#N` spellings failed in the 0-of-7
  run, so the form is not the variable. Never treat a merged bundle as
  self-closing: `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` Phase 3.6 reconciles each link
  against the issue's real state after the merge
  (`fixes_scope.reconcile_link_closure`), and a straggler is reported
  for the supervisor to confirm — not closed silently.

- `merge_pr(use_bot=…)` executes the merge under the GitHub App
  identity so `merged_by` distinguishes a gated merge from a human one
  (GH-1272). Omit it to read the durable `github_app.merge_bot` key.
  It never fails the merge: the payload's `merged_as` is `"bot"` or
  `"engineer"`, and `bot_fallback` names the reason whenever the bot
  path was skipped — `not requested`, `admin/auto merge has no bot
  transport` (neither flag has a REST equivalent), `no installation
  token`, or `bot merge refused: …` when a ruleset excludes the bot.
  Trust `merged_as`, not the parameter you passed: the installation
  token is minted once and threaded into the request precisely so a
  second resolution cannot fail into engineer credentials while the
  payload still claims the bot merged. The bot path also reports
  `branch_deletion_error`, since the REST merge does not delete the
  head ref and a protected ref refuses the follow-up `DELETE`.

- `pr_get` returns `files`, the complete changed-file list (GH-1265).
  Callers previously hand-rolled `gh api repos/.../pulls/N/files`, whose
  30-item default page silently truncated a 41-file PR and produced a
  false-negative "did the frontend change?" merge gate. The field is
  GraphQL-backed, so the REST page size does not apply.

- `create_pr` assembles the body from `job_story` plus a generated
  commit list — anything else the caller wanted in the body has
  nowhere to go, so it was silently dropped (GH-1073). Pass `body=`
  to supply the whole body instead: it is used verbatim, the
  two-pass commit-list rewrite is skipped, and the JTBD marker check
  runs against your text rather than `job_story`. `Fixes:` is still
  normalized to the last line. Keep using `job_story=` for an
  ordinary PR — `body=` is for callers that own the full body.

- `create_pr(head=…)` names the branch to open the PR from (GH-1073).
  Without it the branch comes from the invoking process's CWD, so a
  caller acting for another checkout — the foreman watchdog opening a
  PR for a worker, any cross-worktree orchestrator — had no way to
  say which branch it meant. `head=` is honoured regardless of CWD,
  and the base-branch refusal (GH-873 F1) applies to it. Omitting it
  keeps the CWD-derived behaviour.

- `create_pr(milestone=…)` / `update_pr(milestone=…)` assign a
  milestone by title or number (GH-1098). Nothing on the MCP surface
  could write that field before, so a PR opened through the
  sanctioned path always had `milestone: null` and
  `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` Phase 3.5 (post-merge milestone cleanup)
  silently took its skip branch on every milestone-bundle PR. The
  write goes through the `issues/{n}` endpoint — the `pulls/{n}`
  endpoint has no milestone field — so `gh pr edit --milestone` stays
  routed to `update_pr`. Clearing a milestone is not supported.

- `create_pr(closes=[...])` is NON-CLOSING (GH-958). The parameter
  emits `Closes #N` lines into the PR body *above* the `Fixes:`
  trailer, and GitHub's auto-close automation never fires on them on a
  merge to `develop` — only the `Fixes:` trailer auto-closes its issue.
  Treat `closes=` as informational cross-referencing: for a
  milestone-bundle PR, close every non-`Fixes:` issue manually with
  `issue_close` after the merge, and verify each one rather than
  assuming the bundle self-closed.

- `issue_create` / `issues_bulk_create` accept `milestone` and
  `labels`, and filing is expected to POPULATE them (GH-1102). Reach
  them through `Dev10x:ticket-create`, whose Step 4 reads the live
  roster via `triage_roster` and proposes a milestone plus label set;
  calling `issue_create` bare is what left 11 of 16 open issues
  unmilestoned and 10 of 13 unlabeled in the 2026-08-30 sweep. When no
  milestone fits confidently, the skill files `needs-triage` rather
  than nothing, so strays stay findable with one query. `triage_roster`
  is read-only and returns `{"milestones": [...], "labels": [...]}` —
  open milestones only.

- `issue_close` called with a pull-request number fails loud with
  `"N is a pull request; use pr_close"` instead of surfacing the raw
  `gh issue close` rejection (GH-924) — reach for `pr_close` instead
  of retrying `issue_close` with a different `reason`/`comment`.
- `push_safe` failure returns `{"pushed": false, "blocked_reason":
  "push_failed"}` with no further diagnostic; a successful push may
  return `{}` — treat any non-`error` payload without
  `"pushed": false` as success.

- `push_safe` protection resolves in three tiers (GH-1031): a
  non-empty `protected_branches` argument, else the durable
  `protected_branches` key in the matching `projects[]` entry of
  `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml`, else the script default
  `main master develop development staging trunk`. Each tier
  REPLACES the one below rather than adding to it. A plain push is
  always allowed and `--force` is blocked on a protected branch;
  `--force-with-lease` is allowed on any branch, but a protected
  target is fetched first and refused as `base_behind_remote` unless
  the remote tip is already an ancestor of the pushed ref (GH-1270) —
  a lease alone compares against the local remote-tracking ref, so a
  stale one leases cleanly and drops every merge landed since. Prefer
  the durable pref over a per-call list: an
  unattended agent never passes one, which is when an unprotected
  force-push costs the most. Three docs previously stated three
  different defaults ("main, develop", "main master", and the real
  six) — `tests/git/test_git.py` now pins the documented list to the
  shell script so that drift cannot recur.
- `unresolved_threads` runs in two modes: with `pr_number` it issues
  a single per-PR `reviewThreads` GraphQL query (sub-2s, returns
  `{"unresolved_threads": [...], "count": N}`); without it, it sweeps
  up to `limit` merged PRs (slower — one subprocess pair per PR —
  returns `{"prs": [...], "count": N}`). For a single-PR check always
  pass `pr_number` (GH-710).
- `ci_check_status(wait=true)` no longer ends its wait on a failed
  NON-required check while other legs are pending (GH-1065). The
  blended `verdict` flips to `failing` the moment ANY check fails, so
  one environmentally-red advisory bot — `claude-review` during an
  org-wide API cap — returned `failing` instantly with three legs still
  pending, and the caller could only re-poll by hand. `wait_out_pending`
  (default `true`) settles the remaining legs first, then returns the
  full verdict with the failed leg named in `checks` and `pending: 0`. A
  failed **required** check still returns immediately — it blocks the
  merge however the other legs land — and the poll budget still bounds
  the loop, so a leg that never settles ends the wait rather than
  hanging it. Pass `wait_out_pending=false` for the old
  return-on-first-failure behaviour.
- `ci_check_status(wait=true)` takes `wait_for`, a list of check names
  that must settle before the wait ends **even when a REQUIRED check
  has already failed** (GH-1138). `wait_out_pending` does not cover
  that case by design — a failed required leg blocks the merge however
  the rest land, so returning at once is right for a caller deciding
  whether to merge. It is wrong for a caller that must not rewrite
  history until the review bots have anchored their comments: on any
  branch carrying `fixup!` commits the required `git-history-linting`
  leg fails **by design** until squash, so "required red + advisory
  legs pending" is a routine mid-review state, not an edge case. A
  Phase 4.6 dispatcher hit exactly that, read the contract correctly as
  "this will not wait", and hand-rolled a `while … gh pr checks …
  sleep 30` loop through the `Monitor` tool — which no Dev10x hook
  validated — then stalled on a prompt. Pass
  `wait_for=["claude-review", "hygiene-review"]` instead. The poll
  budget still bounds the wait, and `conflicting` still returns
  immediately. `Monitor` is on the same PreToolUse validator chain
  as `Bash`, and both `ci-loop-handrolled` and `watch-loop-handrolled`
  are `hook_block: true`.

  **Regression window — GH-1138 through v0.96.0 (GH-1211, GH-1212).**
  For that span the sentence above was aspirational. `hooks.json`
  registered the `Monitor` matcher, but `_validate_bash_body` exited on
  `tool_name != "Bash"` before a single validator ran, so the
  registration was inert: DX001–DX016 never saw a Monitor command, and a
  hand-rolled poll loop routed through `Monitor` reached the supervisor
  as a raw permission prompt that no allow rule can answer. Two narrower
  gaps closed alongside it — the loop patterns were single-line, so a
  `sleep` several lines below `do` could not match (patterns compile
  without `DOTALL`), and `skill_redirect.should_run`'s fast-path token
  filter dropped any command naming none of `commit`/`push`/`checks`/…
  before the rule engine saw it. A loop is matched on its shape now, not
  on the command inside it. Which steer a *PR-shaped* loop receives is a
  separate, still-open question: `gh pr view` is matched by an earlier
  rule, so such a loop gets the one-shot `pr_get` steer rather than
  `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` (tracked on #1100 E21).
- `ci_check_status(wait=true)` budgets its own wait against the
  transport ceiling, and `max_polls` is a request rather than a grant
  (GH-1288). The cap used to be summed inline as `initial_wait +
  poll_interval * max_polls + 60` with nothing bounding it: the default
  came to 1320s — above both deaths GH-1288 reports at ~1137s — and
  `max_polls=500` bought a four-hour one. `dev10x.monitor` now asks
  `polls_within_budget` what `MAX_TOOL_CALL_SECONDS` affords and passes
  that down, so the default 40 is served as 32 (990s of polling under a
  1080s cap). **A slow PR is covered by calling twice, not by asking for
  longer** — the poll count is reduced rather than the subprocess merely
  capped, precisely so the loop ends on its own terms and returns a
  verdict instead of being killed mid-poll and surfacing as a non-zero
  exit. This is the same clamp `run_tests` and `run_node_tests` take,
  reaching the one long-running tool that had been left restating the
  budget in prose.

- `ci_check_status(wait=true)` probes once before sleeping and returns
  straight away when the verdict is already terminal (GH-1088). A call
  that lands after CI finished costs one API round trip instead of the
  60s `initial_wait` it used to pay unconditionally, so a worker that
  reaches the check late is no longer parked behind a wait for a
  verdict GitHub had already decided. Checks that have not registered
  yet summarize as `empty`, which is not terminal — a genuine
  post-push call still waits normally.

- `ci_check_status` corroborates a zero before reporting one, and says
  which source produced it in `checks_source` (GH-1376). `gh pr checks`
  under-reports: PR #1372 had a completed, successful `PR Hygiene
  Review` run that the Actions runs API listed and the CLI did not,
  persistently and across two sessions. Because this tool is the only
  sanctioned CI-wait path — `ci-loop-handrolled` and
  `watch-loop-handrolled` are `hook_block: true` — an uncorroborated
  zero gets acted on. So a zero read is now cross-checked against
  `repos/{repo}/actions/runs?branch=<head>`, filtered to the PR's head
  SHA, and `checks_source` reports `confirmed-zero` (both sources
  agree), `runs-api` (the CLI was wrong and the verdict is built from
  the runs), or `gh-pr-checks`. A runs-API call that cannot be made
  returns `{"error": …, "undetermined": true}` rather than a zero — an
  unreadable second source is not evidence about the first. The two
  extra calls are paid **only** on the zero path, so a poll with checks
  to report costs exactly what it did before. `required_only` reads are
  exempt: an empty required set is normal on an unprotected base
  (ADR-0024) and the runs API cannot say which runs the host requires.

- **`required_verdict: "empty"` is a normal merge-time state on this
  repo, not a pending one (GH-1381).** `develop` registers no required
  status checks (ADR-0024), so `required_verdict` is `"empty"` on every
  green, mergeable PR — it is the terminal value the field settles on,
  never a step on the way to `"green"`. Two workers each sat on a
  fully-passed PR without merging (#1362 at 7/7, #1360 at 6/6) because
  they read `empty` as "required checks haven't passed yet"; both
  needed orchestrator intervention. The blended `verdict` — not
  `required_verdict` — is what a merge decision branches on here:
  `verdict: "green"` means merge, regardless of what `required_verdict`
  says. This is distinct from the transient `empty` two bullets up,
  which describes `verdict` before GitHub has registered any checks at
  all; `required_verdict: "empty"` persists for the PR's whole life on
  an unprotected base.
- `pin_tracker` / `tracker_status` carry the project's issue-tracker
  choice (GH-768). `ensure-base` and `seed_worktree` seed only that
  tracker's MCP rules, so a Jira user stops collecting ~35 inert
  `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__*` allows while their own Atlassian tools
  prompt on first use. The choice is a durable `tracker:` key in the
  matching `projects[]` entry of `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml` —
  same repo-stem keying as `pin_gate_preset`, so one answer covers a
  repo and every worktree of it. Gate the onboarding ask on
  `tracker_status` → `pinned: false`; note that `pinned` reports
  whether a *project entry* names one, while `tracker` always reports a
  resolved value (defaulting to `linear`, the pre-GH-768 behaviour, so
  upgrades lose nothing). v1 covers Linear / Jira / GitHub Issues;
  GitLab and ClickUp are deliberately unsupported rather than shipped
  as empty blocks.

- `pin_ide` / `ide_status` carry the same fact for the project's IDE
  (GH-1261), and `ensure-base` folds that IDE's block the way it folds
  the tracker's. Two things differ from `pin_tracker`. First, the
  resolved default is `none`, not a named IDE: every project has a
  tracker, but most checkouts run no IDE MCP server, so an unpinned
  repo folds nothing rather than seeding a guess — `pinned: false` is
  the unanswered flag, and a resolved `none` is a real answer. Second,
  an IDE block carries **denies** as well as allows: a tool that runs a
  terminal command is a Bash call the PreToolUse chain never sees, so
  its three shell-equivalent tools are denied unconditionally — in
  `base_denies`, not only under the IDE's own key — because the hazard
  does not depend on which IDE was pinned. `seed_worktree` folds
  neither the IDE block nor the tracker block; that pre-existing
  asymmetry is unchanged here.

- `pin_gate_preset` persists a Phase-0 preset pick into the global
  `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml`, keyed by the repo stem read from the
  git **common dir** — so a pick made inside worktree `<repo>-3` also
  covers `<repo>` and a `<repo>-9` created later (GH-855). It is
  idempotent: an entry already covering the checkout is replaced, never
  duplicated. Gate the ask on `preset_pin_status` → `pinned: false`
  (the first-pick condition); asking on every pick is the friction the
  pair exists to remove. Nothing is written under a repo's `.claude/`
  (ADR-0018), so the self-settings gate never fires.

- `pin_supervisor_review` / `supervisor_review_status` carry the
  ADR-0022 D-2 review-boundary fact — does the supervisor read this
  repo's PRs before the next step is allowed (`required` | `none`)
  (GH-1165). `pin_gate_preset` is **not** superseded: it still owns the
  Phase-0 preset/overlay/per-gate-override triad (`_ENUM_TOGGLES`), and
  `supervisor_review` is deliberately not one of those toggles — it is a
  project-wide fact, not a gate-instance decision, so it needed its own
  writer rather than a `gate_overrides` entry. Both pins share the same
  repo-stem keying and the same `pin_project_prefs` writer, and both are
  idempotent: an entry already covering the checkout is replaced, never
  duplicated. Gate the onboarding ask on `supervisor_review_status` →
  `pinned: false` — the deprecated `human_review` boolean alias (ADR-0019)
  still counts as pinned for one release, so a repo migrated before this
  tool existed is not reported as unset. Nothing is written under a
  repo's `.claude/` (ADR-0018).
- `resolve_gate` returns `{gate, effect (ask|auto-advance|skip),
  resolved_option, log_to, reason, floors_applied,
  anchor_recommendations}`; on an `auto-advance` it adds a `record`
  key carrying the visible D-7 line (`⚙ gate:… → "…" (reason)`),
  absent for `ask`/`skip` (ADR-0016 #754). Session policy is read
  from `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml` through `gate_preset` /
  `gate_overlays` / `gate_overrides` and nothing else — GH-1162
  deleted the read-compat seam that used to translate the v1
  `friction_level` / `active_modes` / `walk_away` keys, so a config
  still carrying them is **refused** with an error naming
  `dev10x config migrate-schema` rather than silently resolving to a
  posture nobody wrote. An omitted `gate_overlays` inherits nothing.
  The durable project pin lives at git-tracked
  `.dev10x/gate-policy.yaml` (legacy `.claude/Dev10x/gate-policy.yaml`
  still read as a fallback, #752).

Parameter normalization (accepting aliases, defaulting `repo` from
CWD, richer `push_safe` diagnostics) is tracked as follow-up work;
until it lands, the table above is the contract.

When adding a new tool, update this table and note any dependencies on
specific CLI commands or external programs. Skills should declare required
tools explicitly in `allowed-tools:` to catch availability mismatches early.

### A Bash guardrail does not constrain an MCP tool that shells out (GH-1261)

`_validate_bash_body` returns on `tool_name != "Bash"` before a single
validator runs. So an MCP tool that executes a shell command or evaluates
arbitrary code — `execute_terminal_command`, `execute_code_on_kernel`,
`execute_tool`, or whatever the next server calls its equivalent — is a
Bash call that the Bash layer never sees. Allowing one voids **all** of:

- DX001–DX016, the entire PreToolUse validator chain (the same early
  return GH-1211/GH-1212 documented for `Monitor`);
- every `Bash()` deny in settings — `sudo`, `git push --force`,
  `rm -rf /`, `gh api --method DELETE`, `git config --global`;
- the skill-redirect hook, so nothing routes `gh pr edit` to `update_pr`.

This is GH-1260's sharpest case: rules and hooks match a **tool name and
a command string**, never an **effect**. Assess every new server against
it — a shell or eval tool belongs in `deny`, not in the allow catalog,
and that deny is unconditional rather than keyed to whether the user
picked that IDE. `plugin-doctor`'s `shell-equivalent-mcp-tools` strategy
flags them, but detection is by name and so is a floor, not a guarantee.

### A registered tool is not a pre-approved tool (GH-1153)

Neither this table nor a skill's `allowed-tools:` grants permission.
The only thing `ensure-base` seeds into settings files is
`base_permissions` in `skills/upgrade-cleanup/projects.yaml`, so a tool
missing from that catalog prompts on **every** call, in every project,
forever — while looking fully wired up everywhere a reader would think
to check.

`triage_roster` was the worked example: registered, declared in
`Dev10x:ticket-create`'s front matter, and present in the table above
— and still prompting. The guard that found six more of them
(`audit_hook_log_path`, `audit_hook_recent`, `background_preamble`,
`resolve_plugin_origin`, `slack_thread_is_forward`, all read-only and
all now catalogued) is
`tests/skills/permission/test_catalog_covers_mcp_tools.py`.

So a new tool needs **three** edits, not two:

1. the `@server.tool()` registration,
2. a row in the table above,
3. an entry in `base_permissions` — or, for a tool that mutates state,
   an entry in `dev10x.skills.permission.enumerate_mcp.WRITE_TOOLS_NOT_SEEDED`
   so it keeps prompting on purpose.

`permission enumerate-mcp` reports un-catalogued tools at runtime from
that same exclusion set, so the CLI and the test cannot disagree.

**Not every write is excluded (GH-1215).** A write whose raw-CLI
equivalent the skill-redirect hook *blocks* — everything in the routed
map below (`gh pr edit` → `update_pr`, `gh pr ready` → `pr_ready`, the
`milestone_*` family, and the `task_index_*` trio, which is the park
family's only sanctioned write path) — belongs in `base_permissions`
alongside the already-catalogued `create_pr` / `issue_create` /
`push_safe`. Declining to seed the only remaining route does not add a
safety margin; it makes the sanctioned path prompt while the
unsanctioned one is denied, leaving the caller nowhere to go.
`WRITE_TOOLS_NOT_SEEDED` is for writes a caller can reasonably be
stopped on: `merge_pr`, the three `pin_*` policy writers,
`request_sampling`, `record_rule_feedback`, `record_upgrade`.

**The guard only sees what discovery sees (GH-1215).** `discover_mcp_tools()`
scanned a hard-coded five-module list against twelve tool modules and
matched only `@server.tool()`, so `@github_tool`-wrapped handlers —
48 of ~50 GitHub tools — were invisible along with all of
`gate_tools.py`. The guard passed 3/3 on develop while blind to roughly
four fifths of the surface, `resolve_gate` included. Discovery now globs
`src/dev10x/mcp/*_tools.py` and accepts any decorator named `*_tool`,
and `test_discovery_sees_every_registration` counts registration
decorators in the tree and fails when discovery finds fewer — so
narrowing the scan fails loudly instead of shrinking the guard's field
of view. A new registration wrapper must keep the `_tool` suffix.

## Skill Usage

In SKILL.md, declare MCP tool access via `allowed-tools:`:

```yaml
allowed-tools:
  - mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker
  - mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_comments
  - Bash(/path/to/script:*)
```

Use wildcard sparingly: `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__*` grants access to all cli
server tools. Prefer explicit tool names for security and clarity.

## Server Registration

Each MCP server must be registered in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "cli": {
    "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/cli_server.py",
    "env": { "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1" }
  }
}
```

- Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for relative paths (not hardcoded paths)
- Server names must not conflict with existing tool or skill names
- All referenced command paths must exist and be executable

## Common Mistakes

### Prefer MCP tool calls over direct script invocation

When an MCP tool wraps a CLI script, **use the MCP tool call** as
the primary invocation method. MCP calls avoid permission friction
(no `Bash()` allow-rule needed) and provide structured responses.

```
# ✅ PREFERRED — MCP tool call (no permission prompt)
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp(namespace="git", prefix="msg", ext=".txt")

# ⚠️ FALLBACK — direct script (needs Bash allow-rule)
/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh git msg .txt
```

Use the direct script only when the MCP server is unavailable
(e.g., inside a shell script that runs outside Claude's tool-use
protocol).

### MCP tool names cannot appear in shell scripts

MCP tool names (e.g., `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp`) are
Claude tool-call primitives. They cannot be used inside bash
code blocks, shell scripts, or Makefiles — only via Claude's
tool-use protocol.

```bash
# ❌ WRONG — MCP name in a bash block (not a shell command)
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp git commit-msg .txt

# ✅ CORRECT — use the underlying CLI script in shell contexts
/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh git commit-msg .txt
```

MCP tool names belong only in:
- `allowed-tools:` declarations in SKILL.md front matter
- Claude tool-call invocations (the agent calls the tool directly)
- Documentation describing which tools a skill uses

### Routed GitHub CLI operations

The skill-redirect hook routes documented `gh` operations to MCP
wrappers. Use the MCP tool; the raw CLI is a fallback only when
the MCP server is unavailable.

| Raw CLI | MCP tool |
|---------|----------|
| `gh issue view` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_get` |
| `gh issue create` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_create` |
| `gh issue edit` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_edit` |
| `gh issue edit --add-label` / `--remove-label` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_labels` (GH-1322) |
| `gh issue close` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_close` |
| `gh issue reopen` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_reopen` |
| `gh issue comment` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_comment` |
| `gh issue list` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_list` (advisory) |
| `gh pr view` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_get` |
| `gh pr list` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_list` (GH-1359, advisory) |
| `gh api .../milestones POST` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__milestone_create` |
| `gh api .../milestones/{n} PATCH state=open` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__milestone_reopen` |
| `gh api .../milestones/{n} PATCH` (title/desc/state/due) | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__milestone_edit` |
| `gh api .../milestones GET` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__milestone_list` (GH-1319) |
| `gh pr edit` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__update_pr` |
| `gh pr ready` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_ready` |
| `gh pr edit --add-label` / `--remove-label` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_labels` (GH-1008) |
| `gh pr close` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_close` (GH-924) |
| `gh pr create` | `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` (wraps `create_pr`) |
| `gh pr merge` | `Dev10x:gh-pr-merge` (wraps `merge_pr`) |

For a stale severity token in a **review body** (state=COMMENTED)
that trips gh-pr-merge Check 1b, edit it via
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_review_edit` (GH-778) — the review-body
counterpart to `pr_review_comment_edit` (inline) and
`issue_comment_edit` (top-level).

### Routed test commands (S12 map)

The `diag-friction` command-skill map (`command-skill-map.yaml`)
advisorily routes test runners to MCP wrappers so they run off the
Bash layer — sidestepping the core-harness brace-expansion block that
no allow-rule can suppress (GH-703).

| Raw command | MCP tool |
|-------------|----------|
| `pytest` / `uv run pytest` | `Dev10x:py-test` (wraps `run_tests`) |
| `jest` / `yarn … test` / `npm test` / `pnpm test` / `vitest` | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__run_node_tests` |

`run_node_tests` accepts a `runner` arg (`jest` default, plus
`vitest`/`yarn`/`npm`/`pnpm`); `jest`/`vitest` get `--coverage` when
`coverage=true`.

Its `cwd` — like every tool's — must be **absolute** (GH-1264). A
relative path is now rejected at the `use_cwd` seam rather than
resolved against the long-lived server's own directory, which is not
the caller's checkout: `cwd="apps/web"` ran somewhere else entirely and
returned green, certifying a tree the worker had never written to. The
success payload also carries `cwd`, the directory the run actually
happened in, so a green result can be audited instead of trusted.

It also takes `script` and `env` (GH-1029). `script` names the
`package.json` script to run — default `"test"`, which keeps the
historical `yarn test` / `npm test` shape; any other value becomes
`<pm> run <script>`, so a `lint:tsc` or `lint` check runs inside the
wrapper instead of as a raw `tsc`/`node` invocation on the Bash
layer. Only `yarn`/`npm`/`pnpm` resolve a script name — pairing
`script` with `jest`/`vitest` returns an error rather than silently
ignoring it, since those are invoked directly through `npx` and have
no script table. `env` is overlaid on the inherited environment (not
substituted for it), for a script whose own definition pins something
the wrapper would otherwise drop — e.g. a `TZ` that snapshot tests

We do **not** use [`github/github-mcp-server`](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server).
The internal `Dev10x:cli` server is the sole GitHub surface — its
composite tools are shaped to Dev10x workflows rather than mirroring
the REST/GraphQL primitives.

When a new GitHub capability is needed (Actions, code scanning,
notifications, etc.), add a Dev10x-shaped composite tool to this
server rather than pulling in the official one. The official server's
source is a useful reference for endpoints and GraphQL queries; it
is not a runtime dependency.

Full rationale, overlap map, and implementation plan:
