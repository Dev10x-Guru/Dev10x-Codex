# Hook Implementation Patterns

Guidance for maintaining consistent implementations when hooks exist
in multiple languages (Python and shell).

## When This Pattern Applies

When a PR adds a Python implementation of a hook that already exists
as a shell script (or vice versa), both implementations should be
functionally equivalent and use identical schemas.

Examples:
- `session_persist()` (Python) mirrors `session-stop-persist.sh`
- `session_goodbye()` (Python) mirrors `session-stop-goodbye.sh`

## Verification Checklist

### 1. Input/Output Schema Equivalence

- Both implementations read from identical stdin format (JSON)
- Both implementations write to identical stdout/file format
- Field names are identical across implementations
- Field types are compatible (JSON `true`/`false` vs shell
  `"true"`/`"false"`)

### 2. Error Handling Parity

- Both implementations handle missing stdin identically
- Both implementations handle malformed JSON identically
- Both implementations use same exit codes for error conditions
- Both implementations produce same error messages (or equivalent)

### 3. Fallback Value Consistency

- For optional fields, both implementations use identical defaults
- Missing/null values are handled the same way
- No silent failures due to different default handling

### 4. Data Type Representation

- Booleans: JSON `true`/`false` vs shell string `"true"`/`"false"`
  — aligned
- Integers: JSON `123` vs shell `"123"` — explicitly tested
- Lists: JSON array `[...]` vs shell multiline/CSV — conversion
  verified
- Timestamps: identical format (ISO8601, UTC, etc.)

### 5. Cross-Language Testing

- At least one test invokes shell implementation and parses output
- At least one test invokes Python implementation and parses output
- Both outputs are compared for schema equivalence
- Test covers at least one error condition with missing/null data

## Anti-Patterns

- Implementing Python version without testing against shell version
- Renaming fields during port (field name divergence)
- Different type representations (bool vs string) not caught by tests
- Different error handling (one throws, other returns null) — silent
  divergence
- Different fallback values in readers (one uses `""`, other uses
  `"unknown"`)

## Direct-Shebang + Orchestrator Pattern (GH-959)

**Default every new hook entry to a direct-shebang script wrapped
with `audit-wrap`.** Consolidate multi-entry events (SessionStart,
Stop) into a single orchestrator that runs features in-process.

### Anti-pattern: `uv run --project` entries

```json
"command": "uv run --project $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT dev10x hook session tmpdir"
```

Every invocation pays `uv` project-resolution, env-build, and the
full CLI import cost — even for trivial hooks. SessionStart fired
5 such entries on every session, multiplying the penalty.

### Correct pattern

```json
"command": "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/scripts/audit-wrap session-start $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/scripts/session-start.py"
```

- `audit-wrap` records total_ms (including startup)
- The Python script uses a PEP 723 inline-metadata shebang
  (`#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`)
- The orchestrator imports feature functions from
  `dev10x.hooks.*` and runs them in-process

### Consolidation checklist

When multiple feature functions share one event, create ONE
orchestrator script that:

1. Reads stdin **once**, parses the JSON into `data`
2. Passes `data` to each feature function (features accept an
   optional `data: dict | None` parameter; backward-compat stdin
   read when `None`)
3. Wraps each feature with `@audit_hook(name=..., event=...)`
   so body-phase timing lands in the JSONL log
4. Isolates failures — a raising feature must not skip the rest
   (catch `SystemExit` and `Exception` per feature)
5. For `additionalContext` producers (session_reload,
   session_guidance), extract a `build_*_context()` helper that
   returns the string; orchestrator merges all strings into one
   envelope
6. Preserves stdout when it matters (session_goodbye prints to
   the user); use `contextlib.redirect_stdout` in the orchestrator
   only for features that emit structured JSON

### A Stop Feature May Carry a Verdict (GH-1251)

The Stop orchestrator no longer discards return values. A feature may
return a verdict; the orchestrator merges them and emits **at most one**
envelope, mirroring what `SessionStart` does for `additionalContext`
(item 5 above).

Three constraints came out of building the first one:

1. **Ordering resolves the stdout collision.** `session_goodbye` prints
   to the user's terminal while a blocking decision must print JSON on
   stdout — the Stop orchestrator is the first to hold both kinds at
   once. Item 6 above prescribes `contextlib.redirect_stdout` for
   structured emitters; the resolution here is to capture the goodbye
   and **replay it only when nothing blocks**. A farewell printed while
   the turn is being continued asserts the session ended when it did
   not.
2. **A raising feature must not block.** `_verdict` returns `None` on
   any exception. A check that failed to run is not evidence that a
   gate was skipped, and the failure mode of guessing wrong here is a
   turn that cannot end.
3. **Two loop guards, not one.** A hook that always blocks needs
   `stop_hook_active` — but that is a documented harness contract this
   repo had never exercised, so it is paired with a
   cooldown marker keyed by session id. Either one alone suffices;
   together they survive the field being absent or renamed.

   **Retiring the marker needs evidence, and the evidence is now
   recorded (GH-1257).** The pair is meant to collapse to one once
   `stop_hook_active` is trusted, but nothing observed it: the audit
   log carried only wrap-phase timing, so "does a continuation arrive
   with the field set?" could not be answered from the field at all —
   and an unverifiable precondition is how belt-and-braces calcifies
   into permanent dead weight. `StopVerdict.signal` now names which
   branch ended the turn (`stop_hook_active`, `cooldown_marker`,
   `no_transcript`, `asked`, `blocked`) and `build_stop_verdict`
   attributes it to the audit record under `rule_id: stop-verdict`.
   Remove the marker when `stop_hook_active` appears there across a
   few harness versions — not before, and never merely because the
   guard looks redundant: what it prevents is a hook that re-blocks
   every turn forever.

   **Query `signal`, and group by `harness_version` (GH-1390).** Until
   GH-1390 neither key was written: the branch went into the generic
   `reason` slot `set_decision_attribution` gives every validator, so a
   reader following this paragraph queried `.signal` and got a zero —
   indistinguishable from the branch never firing, and a session acting
   on that reading nearly retired a guard a wider re-measurement found
   firing repeatedly. `reason` still carries the same value for
   back-compat; prefer `signal`. `harness_version` is read off the
   transcript the harness stamps it on, and is the literal `unknown`
   when unreadable — never absent, since an absent key re-creates the
   ambiguity this fixed. The marker goes only when all three agree:
   `stop_hook_active` present, `cooldown_marker` absent, across a few
   distinct `harness_version` values.

4. **Ask who is listening before blocking (GH-1314).** "A turn always
   ends on a widget" presumes a supervisor on the other end, and two
   cases have none. A **subagent** hands its report back to whoever
   dispatched it — one was observed echoing this module's own
   no-open-work steer as a status question, complying with a block it
   should never have received. A session on **standby** has a
   supervisor who has explicitly said "stop asking until I speak";
   without that answer the widget's only replies re-arm it next turn,
   which is a gate with no exit rather than a gate.

   Standby is scoped by reading the turn's boundary user message, not
   a clock: a marker naming the same message means nothing has been
   said since, a different one means it has and the marker is dropped.
   That keeps it a pause rather than a disable, and keeps the lifetime
   free of a second writer. Both branches carry their own
   `StopSignal` — a branch nobody can observe is a branch nobody can
   retire or trust, the same argument GH-1257 made for the other five.

**Keep the decision out of the hook.** `dev10x.hooks.stop_verdict`
holds the rule and is a pure function over `(payload, plan)`;
`build_stop_verdict` is the wiring that finds the plan and records the
marker. That split is what makes the rule testable without a
subprocess — the same separation `dev10x.hooks.format_scope` got under
GH-1143 — and it is why `decide` reads the marker but never writes it.

### Adding a new SessionStart/Stop feature

1. Write the logic in `src/dev10x/hooks/session.py` with an
   optional `data: dict | None` parameter
2. Add a call to the feature inside
   `hooks/scripts/session-start.py` (or `session-stop.py`),
   wrapped with `@audit_hook`
3. Add a test in `tests/hooks/test_orchestrators.py` verifying
   the feature runs and the orchestrator exits cleanly

Do NOT create a new hook entry in `hooks/hooks.json` for a
SessionStart/Stop feature — always extend the orchestrator.

### Audit wrapper application

Every entry in `hooks/hooks.json` is prefixed with `audit-wrap`:

```
$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/scripts/audit-wrap <name> <command-path>
```

This captures total wall-clock timing (including `uv run`
startup) and injects `DEV10X_HOOK_SPAN_ID` so body-phase records
from `@audit_hook` correlate with wrap-phase records.

## A PostToolUse Formatter Stays Inside the Edit (GH-1143)

The `Edit|Write` formatter hook may reformat **only the lines the tool
call touched**, and may never apply lint fixes.

**Why.** The hook ran `ruff format` plus `ruff check --fix` over the
whole file after every edit. Each `Edit`+hook pair is evaluated in
isolation, with no memory of the sequence it belongs to — so a revert
that removed an import in one edit and restored its call site in another
had an *intermediate* state where the import genuinely was unused. F401
stripped it; nothing restored it; the file was left with a `NameError`
at a line nobody had edited. No individual step was wrong. The same pass
also collapsed `if/elif` into an unparenthesised mixed `and`/`or` in a
class the session never touched, and reflowed at 88 columns in a project
that configures 99 and passes its own pre-commit on the original forms.

**Rules for any new PostToolUse formatter:**

1. **Scope to the hunk.** Derive the edited line range from
   `tool_input` and pass it to the formatter (`ruff format --range`).
   Fall back to whole-file only when the range cannot be located, and
   retry whole-file when the tool rejects the range flag (older
   versions).
2. **Never prune imports or apply lint fixes.** Unused-import removal
   needs whole-file intent; a post-`Edit` pass sees one step of a
   possibly multi-step change. Leave it to the project's pre-commit.
3. **Honour the project's configuration.** Read `[tool.ruff]`, then
   `[tool.black] line-length`, then `max-line-length`. A project that
   runs its own pre-commit and configures no ruff formatter is left
   alone entirely — anything the hook rewrites there is net-new
   unreviewed change attributed to whoever commits next.
4. **Say what changed.** "PostToolUse hook modified `<file>` (likely a
   formatter)" does not distinguish reformatted whitespace from a
   deleted name the file still references. Emit a `systemMessage`
   naming the changed lines.

The decision logic lives in `dev10x.hooks.format_scope`, kept separate
from the hook so it is testable without a subprocess.

## Profile Tiers (GH-413)

Bash command validators declare a profile tier so users can dial
hook strictness up or down per session.

### Tier Assignment

| Profile | Validators | When to use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `minimal` | Safety-critical rules only (DX001–DX005) | Quick fixes, throwaway scripts |
| `standard` | Minimal + skill-redirect + prefix-friction | Default for day-to-day work |
| `strict` | Standard + opinionated rules (e.g., commit-jtbd) | Feature branches, shared repos |

Each validator declares `rule_id` (stable identifier like `DX001`)
and `profile` (one of the above tiers). Lower-tier rules run at all
higher tiers — `minimal` rules are always active.

### Rule IDs

| rule_id | Validator | Tier |
|---------|-----------|------|
| DX001 | safe-subshell | minimal |
| DX002 | command-substitution | minimal |
| DX003 | execution-safety | minimal |
| DX004 | sql-safety | minimal |
| DX005 | pr-base | minimal |
| DX006 | skill-redirect | standard |
| DX007 | prefix-friction | standard |
| DX008 | commit-jtbd | strict |
| DX009 | redundant-fetch | standard (experimental) |
| DX010 | bash-aggregation | standard |
| DX011 | pipeline-allow | standard |
| DX012 | safe-expansion | minimal |
| DX013 | mcp-prefix | standard |
| DX014 | sensitivity-target | standard |
| DX015 | spec-drift | standard (experimental) |
| DX016 | inline-linter | standard |
| DX017 | write-destination | standard |

### DX014 Sensitivity Axis: `ask`, Not `deny` (GH-604)

DX014 classifies *what the target is* (SECRET / CREDENTIAL / PII /
INFRA) — the third PAP axis, orthogonal to tier and reversibility. A
read-only-but-sensitive probe (`nc -zv` to infra, `gh secret list`,
`.env` read) is genuinely worth a prompt but must not be hard-blocked:
a hard `deny` drops the user to a manual `!` shell. DX014 therefore
emits `HookAsk` (`permissionDecision: "ask"`, exit 0) so the user can
approve in-session.

Genuine destructive writes are still hard-denied — by the safety-tier
validators (DX001–DX005/DX012), which run **before** DX014 in the
chain and short-circuit on a `deny`. DX014 only ever sees commands the
safety axis already cleared, so its `ask` (and a blessed `allow`, below)
never overrides a real block.

**The operand is classified, not just the shape (GH-1278).** A read is
an *effect* reachable by unbounded means — `cat`, `head`, `rg`, `jq`,
`awk`, `sed`, a redirect, a symlink, different quoting. GH-1260
established by controlled test that neither permission namespace can
close that: a `Read()` rule governs the Read tool only and says nothing
about a Bash command reading the same path, while a blanket
`Bash(rg:*)` allow makes every file on the machine readable with no
prompt. Enumerating readers is therefore not a closure — the next
reader nobody listed evades it.

So DX014 also matches a path wordlist against the command's **operand
tokens** (`.aws/credentials`, `.ssh/`, `*.pem`, `.netrc`, `.pgpass`,
`.npmrc`, `.git-credentials`, `.docker/config.json`, gh's `hosts.yml`,
kubeconfig, service-account JSON, `secrets.y[a]ml`), whatever verb
reached them. `matched_text` carries the whole token rather than the
matched span, because the prompt has to name the file at stake.

This is deliberately **not** a general solution. Filesystem permissions
and not storing secrets in readable files remain the real boundaries;
this closes the cases that matter inside an agent session. Keep the
scope honest when extending it: over-firing is what turns DX014 into
noise, so naming a word (`rg pem src/`) or listing a directory
(`ls ~/.ssh`) must stay silent.

Tokenizing goes through `bash_tokens.split_tokens`, not a local
whitespace split — a split shreds a quoted path containing a space into
fragments that match nothing, silently defeating the guarantee. The
pass costs a bounded number of regex searches over short tokens, which
is noise against the hook budget in `.claude/rules/performance.md`; a
heavier mechanism (a real shell parser) would not be, so re-measure
before reaching for one.

**Sensitivity-exception catalog (Tier 2, synced).** A user-owned
`~/.config/Dev10x/sensitivity-exceptions.yaml` downgrades blessed probes
from `ask` to `allow` (or keeps an explicit `ask`). It lives in the
user config home, so it syncs across every worktree. Entries use a
hybrid target+shape model — an entry applies when *every* supplied
matcher matches:

```yaml
exceptions:
  - description: bastion port probe
    label: infra              # optional: only when every match is this label
    shape: '\bnc\b.*-[zv]+'   # optional: regex on the command string
    target: 'bastion\.example\.internal'  # optional: regex on the command
    effect: allow             # allow (default) | ask
```

At least one of `label`/`shape`/`target` is required; a matcher-less
entry is rejected at load. A `label`-scoped entry only applies when
*all* sensitivity matches share that label, so it cannot silently bless
a command that also trips a second, un-blessed label. First applicable
entry wins (catalog order). A missing/malformed catalog fails open to
the default `ask`. The validator exposes `with_exceptions()` (mirroring
`with_patterns()`) as the injection seam.

### DX017 Scopes to the Working Tree, Not the Command (GH-1245)

`cp`, `mv`, `tee`, `touch` and `install` write files without going
through the `Write` tool, so they never reach `validate-edit-write.py`.
DX017 denies such a command **only when the destination resolves inside
the working tree**; a `/tmp` → `/tmp` copy or any write outside the
checkout is left alone.

The scoping is the whole design. Banning the commands outright would be
friction with no safety payoff — shell staging under a scratch root is
legitimate work. What is not legitimate is landing content in the repo
that no one read: GH-1245 records an 866-line script copied in
sight-unseen, and re-doing it as `Read` + `Write` exposed dead `/tmp`
paths, a duplicated block, and useless timing offsets immediately. A
`cp` cannot discover correctness, because copying is not reading. The
skipped validator and the missing `Edit` baseline are the other two
costs.

`HookInput.cwd` stands in for the working tree deliberately. It is
already the checkout root on every hook invocation, and depending on it
keeps DX017 free of a `git rev-parse` subprocess — with the startup
budget gated by `tests/benchmarks/test_startup_time.py`, a subprocess
per Bash call would be the most expensive check in the chain. An empty
`cwd` makes the validator abstain rather than guess.

A new validator that inspects paths should follow the same shape: decide
from the payload the hook already carries, and scope the denial to the
blast radius that motivated it.

### Configuration

Set via environment variables in `.claude/settings.json` or shell:

```bash
# Select profile tier (default: standard)
export DEV10X_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal

# Disable specific rules by ID (comma-separated)
export DEV10X_HOOK_DISABLE=DX006,DX008

# Enable experimental validators
export DEV10X_HOOK_EXPERIMENTAL=1
```

### Adding an Experimental Validator

New validators that need real-world validation before becoming
active-by-default should ship as `experimental=True`. Users opt
in via `DEV10X_HOOK_EXPERIMENTAL=1`. Once the validator is proven
stable, flip the flag to `False` and bump the tier appropriately.

Register the tier by appending a `ValidatorSpec` to `_SPECS` in
`src/dev10x/validators/__init__.py` (the typed dataclass replaced the
old `_VALIDATOR_SPECS` 5-tuple — see
`dev10x.validators.registry.ValidatorSpec`):

```python
_SPECS: list[ValidatorSpec] = [
    ...
    ValidatorSpec(
        module_path="dev10x.validators.new_rule",
        class_name="NewRuleValidator",
        rule_id="DX009",
        profile=ProfileTier.STANDARD,
        experimental=True,
    ),
]
```

Each validator class declares the same `rule_id`/`profile`/
`experimental` metadata as `ValidatorBase` class attributes; the
registry asserts the two agree at registration time.

### Reviewer Expectations

When adding a new validator:

1. Pick a stable `rule_id` (next free `DXNNN`)
2. Choose the correct profile tier (default: `standard`)
3. Update the rule-ID table above
4. Add a unit test verifying `should_run` and `validate` behavior
5. Add an integration test covering profile filtering if the
   rule has non-trivial scope (optional)
