"""Durable preset pinning — the writer seam behind the Phase-0 gate (GH-855).

When the Phase-0 / ``session_adoption`` gate resolves to ``ask``, the
supervisor picks a preset and the choice evaporates at session end: the
domain resolver only ever *reads* ``friction.yaml`` (ADR-0007 D3 keeps it
I/O-free), and ADR-0018 retired the per-repo ``session.yaml`` that could
once have held it. This module is the infra-tier counterpart: it resolves
the repo identity, then persists the pick into the global
``~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml`` — outside every repo's ``.claude/``, so
Claude Code's self-settings gate never fires.

**Repo-scoped, not worktree-scoped.** A preset picked while sitting in
``bl-zebra-3`` is a statement about *the repo*: the pin is keyed off the
git common dir (the main working tree), so ``bl-zebra``, ``bl-zebra-1``,
and a ``bl-zebra-9`` created next month all match it. Keying off the
invocation CWD would re-prompt in every sibling worktree, defeating the
point of persisting at all.
