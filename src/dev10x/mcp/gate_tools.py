"""Gate-policy MCP tool registration (ADR-0016).

Skills call ``resolve_gate`` at each decision gate instead of reading
``friction_level`` / ``active_modes`` / ``walk_away`` themselves — the
tool loads the session policy, hydrates the shipped presets from
``presets/friction/*.yaml`` (ADR-0016 D-1), applies the
preset/overlay/override/floor pipeline in
:mod:`dev10x.domain.gate_policy`, and returns the resolved effect for the
concrete gate instance. Auto-advances surface a visible D-7 record that is
also appended to the audit log and the configured ``doubt_sink`` (#754).
