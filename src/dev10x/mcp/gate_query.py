"""Service-layer gate resolution query (GH-840).

``resolve_gate_for_toplevel`` had grown into a ~100-line MCP handler that
read the session + project policy, computed the preset/overlay/override/floor
pipeline, resolved the gate, AND performed the D-7 side effects inline —
untestable off the MCP surface and mixing read/compute/write in one place.

This module owns the **read + compute** half as a
:class:`GateResolutionQuery` that returns an assembled
:class:`GateResolutionOutcome` (the concrete ``GateContext``, the
``GateResolution``, and any overlays dropped by the durable-mode guard).
The MCP adapter in :mod:`dev10x.mcp.gate_tools` stays thin: it runs the
query, routes the side effects (audit log + doubt sink), and builds the
wire payload.

    ``friction.yaml`` entries are written by ``pin_gate_preset`` keyed off the

    *invocation* toplevel. Those two disagree inside a linked worktree whose
    directory name is not repo-shaped — an agent worktree at
    ``<repo>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<hash>`` matches neither ``*/<repo>`` nor
    ``*/<repo>-*``. The repo's pinned policy silently evaporated and every gate
    fell back to the ``strict`` baseline, so unattended workers hit an ``ask``
    wall at the merge gate — the exact step the walk-away policy exists to
    automate (#978, PR #973 field case).

    Resolution order deliberately probes the **worktree first**: an entry that
    already matches this directory keeps winning, so a ``dir``-scoped pin still
    means "this one directory" and a ``repo``-scoped pin still covers siblings
    exactly as before. Only when nothing matches do we fall back to the repo
    root, which is where ``pin_gate_preset`` keyed the entry.

    Trade-off, recorded rather than hidden: a ``repo-only`` pin ("main checkout
    alone; sibling worktrees fall back to defaults") no longer excludes a
    linked worktree that has no entry of its own — it now inherits the repo
    pin. Sharing one policy source across every worktree is the explicit intent
    of #978, and a worktree silently running a *different* posture than the
    repo it belongs to was the defect.

    Degrades to ``toplevel`` whenever the repo root is unknowable (not a git
    repo, bare repo, wedged git) — never raises.
