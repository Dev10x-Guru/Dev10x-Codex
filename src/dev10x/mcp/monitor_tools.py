    """Check CI status for a PR and return a structured verdict.

    Args:
        pr_number: PR number
        repo: Repository in owner/repo format
        required_only: Only check required status checks
        wait: Poll until terminal verdict (green/failing/conflicting)
        poll_interval: Seconds between polls (default 30)
        initial_wait: Initial wait before first poll (default 60)
        max_polls: Maximum number of polls to request. A request is
            granted only as far as ``MAX_TOOL_CALL_SECONDS`` affords
            (GH-1288), so the default 40 is served as 32: an in-loop poll
            budget of 990s and a subprocess cap of 1080s. Asking for more
            does not buy more — the ceiling is the transport's patience,
            not this tool's willingness — so a PR needing longer coverage
            is re-checked with a second call rather than one long one.
        wait_out_pending: Under ``wait``, keep polling through a failed
            NON-required check until no leg is pending (default True,
            GH-1065). A failed REQUIRED check still returns immediately.
            Set False for the old return-on-first-failure behaviour.
        wait_for: Check names that must settle before the wait ends, even
            when a REQUIRED check has already failed (GH-1138). On any
            branch carrying ``fixup!`` commits the required
            ``git-history-linting`` leg fails by design until squash, so
            "required red + advisory legs pending" is routine — and
            ``wait_out_pending`` does not cover it. Pass the bot legs
            (e.g. ``["claude-review", "hygiene-review"]``) when the next
            step would invalidate what they anchor to, such as a groom
            that force-pushes the SHAs their comments reference. The poll
            budget still bounds the wait.
        cwd: Effective working directory (GH-979).

    Returns:
        Dictionary with verdict (green/pending/failing/conflicting/empty/
        infra_unavailable), mergeable status, and check details. A
        ``wait=true`` call that exhausts its budget while checks never
        register returns ``infra_unavailable`` — the caller re-invokes or
        escalates rather than treating it as a transient pending. A
        ``failing`` verdict from a ``wait_out_pending`` run names the failed
        leg in ``checks`` and reports ``pending: 0``, so the caller can tell
        an advisory red apart from an unfinished run. ``checks_source``
        (GH-1376) says where the list came from — ``confirmed-zero`` when a
        zero was corroborated against the Actions runs API, ``runs-api``
        when that cross-check overturned a false "no checks reported", and
        ``gh-pr-checks`` otherwise. A cross-check that cannot be made
        returns an error carrying ``undetermined: true``, never a zero.
