    """Wrap a GitHub handler with cwd binding + Result→dict unwrapping.

    The inner ``fn`` returns a ``Result``; this decorator enters
    ``use_cwd(kwargs["cwd"])`` and calls ``to_wire()`` at the MCP
    boundary, so the value FastMCP actually receives is the flattened
    wire ``dict`` — never a ``Result``.

    ``functools.wraps`` preserves the inner signature so FastMCP builds
    the correct *input* schema, but it also copies the inner ``->
    Result[dict]`` return annotation (and sets ``__wrapped__``). Newer
    FastMCP reads that annotation via ``inspect.signature(..., eval_str=
    True)`` and derives an *output* schema from the ``SuccessResult |
    ErrorResult`` union — which then rejects the flattened dict
    ``to_wire()`` returns (GH-712, GH-713: every github tool failed
    output-schema validation despite the underlying call succeeding).

    Pin the public signature's return type to ``dict`` (matching the
    directly-``@server.tool()`` handlers, for which no output schema is
    derived) via an explicit ``__signature__``. ``inspect.signature``
    honours ``__signature__`` ahead of the ``__wrapped__`` chain, so
    this is what FastMCP sees while the inner ``fn`` keeps its honest
    ``Result`` annotation for type-checking.

    """Create a PR with two-pass body generation.

    The `job_story` is validated before the PR is opened (GH-945): a
    story missing any of `**When**` / `**<actor> wants to**` /
    `**so <beneficiary> can**` returns an actionable error instead of
    a body that trips the hygiene bot. The generated body always ends
    at the `Fixes:` line.

    Args:
        title: PR title
        issue_id: Ticket ID extracted from branch name
        job_story: JTBD Job Story for the PR body — must carry all
            three markers (see above). Omit when passing `body`.
        body: Full PR body, used verbatim (GH-1073). Overrides the
            generated job-story + commit-list template entirely, so
            the created PR carries exactly what you supply — nothing
            is appended and no second pass rewrites it. The JTBD
            marker check runs against this text instead of
            `job_story`, and `Fixes:` is normalized to the last line.
        head: Branch to open the PR from (GH-1073). Defaults to the
            effective checkout's current HEAD. Pass it to open a PR
            for a branch you are not sitting on — a watchdog acting
            for a worker, or any cross-worktree orchestrator.
        milestone: Milestone title or number to assign to the new PR
            (GH-1098). Needed for `gh-pr-monitor` Phase 3.5, which
            closes a milestone by reading the PR's own milestone.
        fixes_url: Issue URL for the Fixes: line
        base_branch: Base branch. Auto-detected if omitted.
        closes: Issue numbers to close on merge — emitted as
            `Closes #N` lines (GH-186). Use for milestone-bundle
            PRs that ship multiple issues.
        draft: Create as draft (default True). Pass False in
            solo-maintainer mode so the PR is immediately
            ready-for-review (GH-184).
        head_repo: Fork owner for a cross-fork PR (GH-473). When set,
            the head branch is pushed to that owner's remote and the
            PR opens with `--head <head_repo>:<branch>` against the
            upstream base. Omit for same-repo PRs.
        repo: Target repository as `owner/repo` (GH-1269). Every sibling
            PR wrapper (`pr_get`, `update_pr`, `merge_pr`) accepts this,
            so callers reasonably passed it here too and paid a
            round-trip retry on the validation error. Omit to keep
            detecting the repo from the effective checkout.
        cwd: Effective working directory (GH-979). Pass the worktree
            path after EnterWorktree so the PR is created from the
            worktree's branch, not the main repo's.
        ctx: FastMCP context injected automatically — do not pass (GH-342).

    Returns:
        Dictionary with keys: pr_number (int), url (str)
    """

    Step 5 was unreachable; the checks themselves remain mandatory.

            Resolved by the skill from

        delete_branch: Pass ``--delete-branch`` to ``gh pr merge``
            when True (default).
        admin: Pass ``--admin`` when True — use administrator

            set this, and only after the 7 non-approval checks pass
            (GH-733).
        auto: Pass ``--auto`` when True — enable GitHub auto-merge so
            the PR merges once branch-protection requirements are met
            (GH-733).
        repo: Repository (owner/repo). Auto-detected if omitted.

            *now*, so a push landing mid-gate ships unreviewed code.
        use_bot: Execute the merge under the GitHub App identity so
            ``merged_by`` names the bot and an out-of-gate merge
            becomes visible (GH-1272). Omit to read the durable
