"""Gate policy resolver — presets over toggles (ADR-0016 spike).

Single source of truth for "does this decision gate fire or
auto-resolve?". Skills are policy-ignorant: they call the
``resolve_gate`` MCP tool (which delegates here) instead of reading
``friction_level`` / ``active_modes`` / ``walk_away`` and re-deriving
gate behavior from prose.

Resolution pipeline (ADR-0016 D-4, lowest to highest precedence):

    plugin preset < project override < session preset choice
                  < per-toggle session override < safety floors

Baseline posture (ADR-0022 D-1): ``adaptive`` is the **sole shipped
base preset** — auto-advance is the baseline, and every gate resolves
to its recommended option unless a floor, a project pin, or a
per-toggle override says otherwise. The ADR-0016 D-9 ``strict`` /
``guided`` columns are retired; the postures they reached for are now
expressed by ``supervisor_review`` (ADR-0022 D-2/D-3) and the existing
project-tier ``.dev10x/gate-policy.yaml`` pins.

The preset *mechanism* survives: user-defined presets in
``~/.config/Dev10x/friction-presets.yaml`` and per-toggle overrides
(ADR-0016 D-4) are untouched. Only the shipped three-way *choice* is
gone, so a config naming ``strict`` or ``guided`` now raises
:class:`UnknownPresetError` — loudly, rather than silently resolving at
a more autonomous baseline (the FRIC-M3 migrator rewrites such configs).

GH-1162 retired the read-compat seam that used to translate the v1
vocabulary (``friction_level`` / ``walk_away`` / ``active_modes:
solo-maintainer``) into presets and overlays. A config still speaking it
is now REFUSED — see :func:`legacy_policy_keys` and
:func:`legacy_config_message` — because the alternative is not a neutral
fallback: resolving a ``friction_level: strict`` repo at the sole
remaining baseline would hand it auto-merge.

All functions are free of file I/O (ADR-0007 D3): the caller reads
session/project configuration and passes parsed values in. Shipped
preset value-maps live here as data; the planned
``presets/friction/*.yaml`` files (ADR-0016 Q2) will hydrate the same
structures at the infra tier.

    Empty means the config speaks v2 and resolves normally. Non-empty
    means the retired read-compat seam (GH-1162) would have been the only
    thing translating it, so the caller must refuse rather than resolve —
    see :func:`legacy_config_message` for why refusing is the safe half.

    Each detected key is one the seam actually consumed:

    * ``friction_level`` — the seam's preset leg. Any value counts,
      including a value the parser could not recognise: the shipped
      three-way choice is gone, so *naming a posture at all* is v1.
    * ``walk_away`` — the seam's afk-overlay leg.
    * ``active_modes: solo-maintainer`` — the seam's solo-overlay leg, and
      only when ``gate_overlays`` does not already carry that overlay. A
      migrated config states it in both places (the migrator materialises
      the overlay and leaves ``active_modes`` alone, since modes are a
      playbook/DoD axis), so this fires exactly when the overlay would
      otherwise be silently dropped.
    * ``gate_preset`` naming a retired posture — caught here so the refusal
      names the migrator before ``_merge_layers`` reports a bare unknown
      preset.

    Structural modes (``review-deferred``, ``swarm-child``) were never gate
    concerns and are not v1 markers; a config carrying only those, or
    nothing at all, resolves at the baseline exactly as before.

    Refusing is the SAFE half of retiring the seam, and the half that is

    asked for less: a repo pinned to ``friction_level: strict`` would come
    up auto-merging. CI cannot catch that, because CI has no pre-ADR-0022
