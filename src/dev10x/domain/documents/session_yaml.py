"""Persistence boundary for the split session config (GH-774).

Two sibling documents under ``.claude/Dev10x/`` with different lifetimes:

- :class:`ConfigYamlDocument` — ``config.yaml``, **durable** repo
  preferences (``friction_level``, ``active_modes``, and the ADR-0016
  gate keys). Personal, gitignored, and **copied** source→worktree by
  the ``post-checkout`` hook so every worktree of a repo shares them.
- :class:`SessionYamlDocument` — ``session.yaml``, **ephemeral**
  per-worktree state (``branch``, ``tickets``, continuation prompts).
  Seeded fresh per worktree, never carried between them.

Splitting the two escapes Claude Code's ``.claude/`` self-edit gate: the
hook provisions both files, so no runtime ``Write(.claude/…)`` happens on
the hot path (GH-774 comment 3). ``SessionYamlDocument`` stays the single
read facade — its durable readers prefer ``config.yaml`` and fall back to
a pre-split ``session.yaml`` that still carries the durable keys, so the
migration is transparent (ADR-0007 D3 keeps Policy Rules I/O-free).

    The gate axis of ``Dev10x:friction-setup``: writes a ``projects[]`` entry
    carrying ``gate_preset`` / ``gate_overlays`` / ``gate_overrides``. Only
    durable keys survive (via :meth:`FrictionYamlDocument.with_project`).
    Concurrency-safe and idempotent — an exclusive lock guards the
    read-modify-write and the atomic write leaves no truncated file (GH-827 /
    ADR-0011). Returns the file written.

    ``match`` supplies the entry key; callers pinning a *repo* pass the
    repo-stem globs from :func:`match_globs_for_repo` (GH-855). It defaults to
    the legacy path-derived globs, which are worktree-scoped when ``toplevel``
    is a worktree. ``supersedes`` lists the paths whose existing entries this
    write absorbs (defaulting to ``toplevel``), so a repo already covered by an
    older entry is updated in place instead of gaining a shadowed duplicate.

    ``inherit_from`` (most-specific path first, defaulting to ``supersedes``)
    names the checkouts whose currently-effective entry this write inherits
    non-gate durable keys from, so a narrower entry cannot silently drop the
    ``human_review`` / ``protected_branches`` / overlay-guard settings the
    entry it shadows carried (GH-1068 F3). A worktree caller passes the repo
    root here as well, since no existing entry matches the worktree path.
