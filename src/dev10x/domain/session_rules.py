"""Session policy rules — pure decisions owned by the domain core.

These were previously defined in ``dev10x.hooks.session_policy``, which
forced ``domain.documents.session_context`` to defer its imports into
function bodies to break the cycle ``hooks.session_dispatch →
domain.documents.session_context → hooks.session_policy`` (audit memo
Findings I2 + I10). Each rule depends only on ``domain/`` types, so it
belongs in the core: adapters now import them inward instead of reaching
up into ``hooks/``.

All rules here are free of file I/O (ADR-0007 D3). The session.yaml read
is owned by :class:`dev10x.domain.documents.session_yaml.SessionYamlDocument`;
callers read the parsed values there and pass them in as frozen fields.

See ADR-0008 (context boundary protocol) for the dependency-direction
rule and ADR-0007 for the Policy Rule archetype these satisfy.

      wins: an ``allowed_overlays`` allow-list that forbids the
      solo-maintainer overlay drops it before this ever resolves
      (:class:`ModeGuardRule`), so a team repo never reaches AUTO_MERGE.
