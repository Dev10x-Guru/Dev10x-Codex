"""AuditWriter — domain-owned contract for the hook audit log surface.

This Protocol is a **Separated Interface** (Fowler PoEAA): the
interface lives in the ``domain/`` core while its implementation
lives in a different package (``audit/``). The hooks layer
(``dev10x.hooks.audit_emit``) needs to mint span ids, classify
outcomes, and append audit records, but it must not import the
``audit/`` adapter's internals directly (audit memo Finding I6 — the
``hooks → audit`` inversion). This Protocol declares the surface in the
core; ``dev10x.audit.log_reader`` provides the concrete implementation,
and the hooks layer depends on the Protocol and receives the concrete
writer through a single injection seam. ``ConfigLoader`` in
``dev10x.domain.config_loader`` is the same pattern in the same layer.

See ADR-0008 (context boundary protocol) for the dependency-direction
rule this enforces.
