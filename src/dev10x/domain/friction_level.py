"""Friction level enum — how aggressively a session pauses for confirmation.

Replaces scattered string-equality checks (``friction_level == "adaptive"``,
``== "guided"``) across hooks, validators, and commands with a single
type-safe enum and a stable parser.

Note: shares the ``STRICT`` member name with ``ProfileTier`` but the two
enums are unrelated. ``ProfileTier`` controls *which validators run*;
``FrictionLevel`` controls *how the work-on orchestrator paces itself*.
Keep type imports explicit at every use site.
