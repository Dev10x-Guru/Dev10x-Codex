"""Single chokepoint for reading ``baseline-permissions.yaml`` (GH-587).

Two consumers used to YAML-parse the baseline catalog independently —
``PolicyCatalog.load`` (projecting into ``list[Policy]``) and
``doctor.load_catalog`` (projecting into a ``Catalog`` dataclass). Two
parsers reading the same file is a schema-drift risk: a change to how the
baseline is read (encoding, tolerance, structural assumptions) had to be
mirrored in both places or they would silently diverge.

This module exposes one loader, :func:`load_baseline_dict`, that both
consumers route through. It only reads and YAML-parses the file into the
top-level mapping; each consumer keeps its own projection model — they
have different downstream consumers and must not be merged.
