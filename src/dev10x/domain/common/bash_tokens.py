"""Shared regexes for recognising bash command tokens.

Several validators and the permission-audit model each need to
recognise the same shell-token shapes (leading env-var assignments,
``git -C <dir>`` prefixes). Defining these patterns once here keeps
their semantics unambiguous — previously ``ENV_VAR_RE`` was duplicated
across three validators and two ``GIT_C_RE`` regexes with *different*
semantics shared a single name in separate modules (GH-583, N24).
