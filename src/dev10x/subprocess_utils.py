"""Shared utilities for calling external scripts via subprocess.

**Pattern: Gateway** (Fowler, *PoEAA*). This module is the Gateway to
the operating-system subprocess boundary: ``run`` / ``async_run`` /
``async_run_script`` wrap every external-process invocation behind one
call surface that transparently routes to the caller's effective
working directory (see ``_effective_cwd`` / ``use_cwd`` below). Callers
never reach for ``subprocess.run`` directly — going through this Gateway
keeps CWD routing, timeout handling, and output parsing in a single
layer. ADR-0013 names the pattern here and on ``dev10x.github``.
