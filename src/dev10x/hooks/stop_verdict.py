"""Decide whether a Stop event should be blocked and steered (GH-1251).

Every mechanism that enforced "do not end a turn on a decision question"
was model-side instruction, and therefore skippable. `Dev10x:ask` owns
the reformulation but is invoked by hand; the GH-149 task-list invariant
is prose in `essentials.md`; `Dev10x:session-wrap-up` runs after the
fact. A Stop hook was already wired and could enforce none of it,
because the orchestrator discarded every feature's return value.

This module is the decision half. It reads the payload and the
transcript and returns a :class:`StopVerdict`; the orchestrator owns
the envelope. Keeping the two apart is what makes the rule testable
without a subprocess — the separation `dev10x.hooks.format_scope` got
under GH-1143.

**The rule.** A turn that ends on an *unanswered decision* hands the
supervisor nothing to answer. That is the block condition. It is
deliberately broader than the conjunction the issue first proposed
("prose block ending in ``?``"): the issue's own third instance
disproved the narrower test, since a plan-approval gate held in prose
as "say go and I'll run 4.1 through 4.11" contains no question mark at
all and cost two extra round trips.

**But a pause is not a decision (GH-1339).** The condition was first
written as "this turn used no widget", which made a block the gate's
single most common outcome — 106 of 224 audit records — and told
sessions holding a pending task to ask the supervisor about work they
had already been told to do. The rule that replaces it comes from the
friction ladder this repo has since collapsed, where ``guided`` meant
"block **with a recommendation**" and ``adaptive`` merely auto-selected
that recommendation:

    A gate fires only where there is no recommended next action.

**Blocking continues the turn (GH-1366).** A Stop hook's ``block``
means *do not stop*: the steer becomes the continued turn's next
instruction. So "auto-advance" — proceed to the next task without
asking — is expressed by BLOCKING with a continue-steer, not by
letting the turn end. An earlier cut read it the other way and let a
session with pending tasks stop at a "natural reporting point".

Open work therefore continues the turn. The discriminator is the
terminal ``Verify acceptance criteria`` task GH-149 keeps open until
the supervisor signs off: since that makes "something is open" true
almost always, what separates "keep going" from "genuinely waiting" is
whether anything *besides* that gate is open.

An **absent task list** is not a depleted one (GH-1055):
the task tools ship by default only on older models, so a session
without them never populates ``plan.tasks``, and ``essentials.md`` says
that emptiness "must not be treated as evidence of anything else".
Conflating the two would block every turn of every such session, which
is the very over-firing this rule ends.

That leaves exactly one blocking state: a task list that exists and is
wholly completed. There the next move genuinely is the supervisor's,
and the steer asks to stand down — carrying its own recommended option
rather than an open-ended "reformulate something".

**A deferral in prose is not a decision.** An earlier cut of this rule
also blocked on closing shapes like "shall I push?" / "want me to…",
reasoning that the agent had taken a decision out of the supervisor's
hands. The supervisor's ruling is that it had not: pushing is forward
and reversible, so the answer is always yes, and asking is the defect.
Blocking never made the agent push — it made it render a widget about
work it should have simply done. Removing that carve-out took the last
guess about English out of the gate; everything left is structural.

**The loop guard is not optional.** A hook that always blocks, without
one, never lets a turn finish. Two independent guards, because the
harness contract is only documented and nothing in this repo exercised
it before (the ``[Verify]`` the issue flags): ``stop_hook_active`` in
the payload, and a per-session marker so a block happens at most once
per turn even if that field is absent or named differently.

**Who the rule is for (GH-1314).** "A turn always ends on a widget"
presumes a supervisor on the other end of it, and two cases have none:

  - a **subagent**, whose final message is its report to whoever
    dispatched it. One was observed echoing the no-open-work steer back
    as a status question — complying with a block it should never have
    received. The branch GH-1314 added for it never once fired, because
    every discriminator it keyed on was a guess at the payload shape;
    GH-1340 replaced the guess with the transcript layout, which is
    observable and was captured before being relied on;
  - a session the supervisor has put **on standby**. "Are we done?" had
    no terminal answer, so confirming it only re-armed the gate next
    turn. Standby is that answer, scoped to the supervisor's next
    message rather than forever.

**A turn ends when the widget is answered (GH-1336).** GH-1334 made the
``asked`` branch reachable by ruling that a tool result is not a turn
boundary. But a widget answer arrives as a tool result, so the window
for every turn after the supervisor clicked an option still held the
original call, and the gate stayed suppressed until they next typed. An
answer is the supervisor speaking and closes the turn it belongs to;
only an *unanswered* widget keeps the gate quiet.

    ended it, which is the one that produced this Stop.
