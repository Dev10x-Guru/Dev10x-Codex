"""Decide what the PostToolUse formatter may touch (GH-1143).

The formatter used to run `ruff format` plus `ruff check --fix` over the
whole file after every Edit. Three things went wrong with that, all
observed in one `tt-e2e` session:

1. **It broke a file by stripping a live import.** A three-Edit revert
   of a `datetime.UTC` rewrite left `from datetime import datetime` while
   line 285 still called `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. Each Edit+hook
   pair is evaluated in isolation, so after edit 1 the `timezone` name
   genuinely *was* unused and F401 removed it; edit 3 restored the call
   site and nothing restored the import. No individual step was wrong;
   the final state was a `NameError`. Unused-import pruning needs
   whole-file intent, which a post-`Edit` pass never has.

2. **It rewrote code nobody edited.** An unrelated `toggle_enabled`
   method in the same file had its `if/elif` collapsed into an
   unparenthesised mixed `and`/`or` expression; two other untouched
   methods acquired `UTC`, `Generator[Page]` and f-string rewrites.
   Equivalent here, but arriving unreviewed and attributed to whoever
   commits next.

3. **It imposed a line length the project rejects.** `tt-e2e` configures
   Black at 99 and passes its own pre-commit on the original forms, so
   the 88-column reflow enforced no project standard at all.

This module answers the two questions that prevent all three: *may we
format this file?* and *which lines?*
