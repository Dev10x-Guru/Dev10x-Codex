"""Hook audit emitters (write side) — decorator + wrap-record helpers.

This module owns the `@audit_hook` decorator wrapped around hook bodies
and the wrap-phase record helpers called by `hooks/scripts/audit-wrap`.

Per ADR-0008 (audit memo I6) it depends on the domain-owned
`AuditWriter` Protocol rather than importing `dev10x.audit.log_reader`
internals directly; the concrete `LogReaderAuditWriter` is resolved
through the single `_get_writer()` seam, so all writes still flow
through `log_reader.append_record` (the reader remains the single
source of truth for log layout).

    The hook body signals its decision by calling ``sys.exit`` from
    ``hook_transport.emit``, so the exit code is all
    :func:`audit_hook` would otherwise see — every block landed in the
    log as a bare ``outcome: block`` with no way to tell DX003 from
    DX010. ``emit`` calls this immediately before exiting; the
    decorator's ``finally`` folds it into the record it already writes.

    The slot is module-level state consumed by the **next** record
    written, and must not outlive it. The SessionStart and Stop
    orchestrators run many ``audit_hook``-wrapped features in one
    process, catching each feature's ``SystemExit`` and continuing, so
    a slot left set by one feature would be misattributed to the next
    feature's record. :func:`audit_hook` therefore clears it after
    every write, not only after a block.

    ``extra`` carries fields a particular ``rule_id`` needs under a name
    of its own (GH-1390). ``reason`` is this function's generic slot and
    every validator's prose lands in it, so a rule whose documentation
    names a different field — ``stop-verdict``'s ``signal`` and
    ``harness_version`` — had nowhere to put it and its readers queried
    a key that was never written. Values are normalized exactly like
    ``reason``, and ``rule_id``/``reason`` win on a name collision so a
    caller cannot rewrite the attribution through the side door.
