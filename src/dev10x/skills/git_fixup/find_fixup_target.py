"""Resolve fixup target commits via git blame on staged hunks.

The legacy approach in ``Dev10x:git-fixup`` selected the fixup target as
the first commit on the branch (``git log --reverse | head -1``), which
attributes fixes to commits that did not own the edited lines. When the
fixup is reordered by ``git rebase -i --autosquash``, a later commit
that touches the same files no longer applies cleanly and conflicts on
modify/delete or content. ``git rerere`` then memoizes the bad
resolution and silently re-applies it on the next attempt.

This module reads the staged diff, locates the pre-image line range for
every modified hunk, and asks ``git blame`` which branch commit last
touched those lines. The owning commit becomes the fixup target. When
the staged change spans hunks owned by more than one branch commit, the
module returns all owners so the caller can split the change into
multiple fixups (one per owning commit) instead of producing a
cross-commit fixup that autosquash cannot fold cleanly.

Output is JSON on stdout; exit codes are 0 (success — single or multi),
1 (error), 2 (no staged changes), 3 (staged hunks land entirely on
commits outside the branch range, e.g. base-branch history).
