"""Shared types for Dev10x:plugin-doctor strategies (GH-87).

Each strategy is a thin module exporting a :class:`Strategy`
constant. The doctor skill iterates registered strategies in
Phase 2, invoking ``detect`` to surface findings and
``remediate`` to materialize the proposed edit.

Strategies must treat the :class:`Context` as read-only — the
doctor's Phase 4 owns all writes. This separation lets the user
review every finding via ``AskUserQuestion`` before any state
changes.
