"""Strategy: ask-shadows-allow (GH-1067).

An ``ask`` (or ``deny``) rule outranks a broader ``allow`` rule, so a
narrow gate silently carves a hole out of a family the catalog already
pre-approved. Nothing in the settings file shows the conflict: both
entries look correct in isolation, and only the prompt at 3 a.m. reveals
that one was overriding the other.

Evidence (GH-1007 E10/D10): a foreman cleanup command
``git branch -D <a> <b>`` hit a confirmation prompt because ask entries
for ``git branch -D`` / ``-d`` were shadowing three existing allow rules
(``git branch:*``, ``-d``, ``--delete``). Unattended, that prompt is a
silent wedge — no one is present to answer it.

The same shape explains the cross-scope split-brain in GH-1069 E2, where
a global ask on ``git stash drop`` shadowed the global ``git stash:*``
allow in every project but the one carrying a local override.

The strategy reports; the doctor's Phase 4 owns the write, and the user
picks which bucket the rule belongs in.
