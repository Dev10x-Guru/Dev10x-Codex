"""Observation logic for the Dev10x:foreman overnight watcher.

Every loop, pipeline, and poll the foreman harness needs lives behind
the ``dev10x foreman`` CLI — never inline in a Monitor/Bash command.
Inline loop/pipeline shapes are permission-matched per call and can
prompt mid-night, freezing the watchdog turn until a human returns
(GH-890; the seven-hour lesson this module encodes).

``WatchState.observe`` is pure — it turns one round of observations
into zero or more event lines — so the night loop itself is a thin,
fully-tested shell around it.
