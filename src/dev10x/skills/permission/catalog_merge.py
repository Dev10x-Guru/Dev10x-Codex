"""Three-way catalog merge for permission base rules (GH-912, ADR-0021).

The userspace catalog (``~/.config/Dev10x/projects.yaml``) used to
*shadow* the shipped one: ``resolve_config`` returned the first existing
candidate, so a userspace file created once by ``permission init`` hid
every safe default shipped afterwards, while ``ensure-base`` validated
against the stale copy and reported success.

This module replaces that selection with a merge::

    effective = shipped ⊕ user_additions ⊖ user_suppressions

Every key carrying *shipped baseline content* merges. Machine-specific
keys (``roots``, ``workspace_directories``, ``include_user_settings``,
``plugin_cache``) stay user-owned and are read from the userspace
catalog alone — see ADR-0021 rule 3.

GH-1248/GH-1249: originally only ``base_permissions`` and
``base_denies`` merged, and every other key fell through an implicit
"pass through untouched" branch. That branch was correct for the
machine-specific keys it was written for, and silently wrong for
``base_asks`` (GH-1149) and ``tracker_permissions`` /
``tracker_denies`` (GH-768) when those shipped later: a catalog
created before them never received them, and nothing reported the
omission. On one observed machine that meant zero ``ask`` rules
reached any settings file, and a repo pinned ``tracker: github`` was
seeded with no github tracker rules at all.

GH-1311 repeated the same omission for ``ide_permissions`` /
``ide_denies`` (GH-1261): both are per-IDE keyed dicts shaped exactly
like ``tracker_permissions`` / ``tracker_denies``, so they merge the
same way. ``ide_denies`` carries the unconditional shell-equivalent-
tool denies GH-1261 shipped, so it joins
:data:`SUPPRESSION_REFUSED_KEYS` alongside ``tracker_denies`` — a user
catalog must not be able to opt an IDE's denies back out.

The classification is now explicit rather than residual:
:data:`MERGED_LIST_KEYS`, :data:`MERGED_TRACKER_KEYS` and
:data:`USER_OWNED_KEYS` name every key, and
:func:`unclassified_shipped_keys` warns about any shipped key in none
of them — so the next key added to the shipped catalog cannot repeat
this by omission.
