"""Keep Dev10x's own session state out of `git status` (GH-1275).

Dev10x writes per-session state to `.claude/Dev10x/` in whichever
checkout it runs in. In any project that tracks `.claude/` — the common
case, since `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/` and `.claude/references/`
are checked in — nothing ignores that path, so every worktree
accumulates an untracked directory and a fresh worktree reads as dirty
the moment a session runs in it.

The rule goes in `.git/info/exclude`, not a tracked `.claude/.gitignore`.
The issue leaves that choice open, but `references/post-upgrade-verification.md`
settles it: a maintenance pass must not write git-tracked content, which
is what keeps it from dirtying reviewed repo state. `info/exclude` also
lives in the **common** git dir, so one write covers a repo and every
worktree of it, where a per-worktree file would need N writes and still
miss the next worktree created.

The tracked spelling is a better fit for something a human commits
deliberately — shared with teammates, surviving a fresh clone — so it is
offered as a suggestion rather than written.
