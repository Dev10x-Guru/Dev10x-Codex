"""Dry-run promotion plan for read-only MCP tools and research WebFetch
domains (GH-470, Increment 1).

MCP approvals are scoped per tool-name x per project-directory, so a
read-only tool used across many projects re-prompts in each one. This
module classifies discovered MCP tools as read-only vs write using a
name-token heuristic and builds a DRY-RUN plan describing which tools
and research-fetch domains WOULD be promoted to global settings.

**Two-phase by design.** ``build_promotion_plan`` only *reports* a plan a
human reviews — it never mutates settings. ``apply_promotion_plan``
(Increment 2, GH-480) writes the approved read-only set + research domains
into global settings, backup-guarded and idempotent, behind an explicit
opt-in (the ``--apply`` flag). The heuristic carries false-positive risk —
e.g. a grant named ``get_access_to_*`` would read as ``read`` by its ``get``
token, so ``access``/``grant``/``authorize`` are write tokens
(write-precedence) — and the dry-run plan remains the safety floor a human
reviews before any auto-write lands.

Classification (write-precedence — safer to under-promote):

- A tool is ``write`` if its short name contains ANY write token.
- Else ``read`` if it contains any read token.
- Else ``unknown``.

Only read tools are promotable. Sensitivity-flagged read tools (private
/ DM / secret access) are reported separately as opt-in — never folded
into the default promotable set. Plugin-distributed tools are skipped:
they are promoted through ``enumerate-mcp`` + base_permissions, not here.
