"""Does every baseline rule reach the seeding path? (GH-1313)

``skills/upgrade-cleanup/projects.yaml`` is the authoritative permission
catalog: ``ensure_base`` and ``seed_worktree`` render settings files from
its flat lists and from nothing else. ``baseline-permissions.yaml``'s
``groups:`` block is a second catalog of comparable size that no seeding
path reads — a rule written there reaches a settings file only if someone
runs ``permission doctor --enable-group`` for its group by name.

That is how GH-1100's E18 and E19 happened twice over: a ``cp`` rule
covering the one path a hard-deny excepts, and a ``git nopager`` rule the
plugin steers agents toward in three places, both existed only in the
grouped catalog. Each was written down, referenced by skills, relied on
by hooks — and still prompted, because being catalogued and being seeded
are different facts and nothing compared them.

This module compares them. :func:`unseeded_baseline_rules` is the
question "which grouped rules cannot reach a settings file", and the
answer must be empty or deliberate.

Three exclusion mechanisms, all explicit by name rather than by
predicate — a predicate absorbs the next omission silently, which is the
failure this module exists to stop:

- :data:`OPT_IN_GROUPS` — tier-3 groups are opt-in by design, so their
  rules are correctly absent from the shipped flat lists. Naming the
  groups instead of filtering on ``tier == 3`` means re-tagging a seeded
  group as tier 3 fails loudly rather than quietly leaving the guard's
  field of view.
- :data:`RULES_NOT_SEEDED` — individual tier-1/tier-2 rules that are
  deliberately not shipped, each carrying its reason. The precedent is
  ``enumerate_mcp.WRITE_TOOLS_NOT_SEEDED``: an explicit list makes an
  omission a conscious edit, where a heuristic absorbs the next one
  silently.
- :data:`UNTRIAGED_BACKLOG` — the 189 divergences that already existed
  when this guard was written. A ratchet, not an exemption: it lets the
  guard bite on *new* divergence today rather than waiting on a triage
  that is a security decision and belongs to a supervisor. It may shrink
  and must never grow.

The seeded side is deliberately not a hand-written list of section
names. It is built by folding every tracker and IDE block into the
config and handing the result to :func:`migrate_flat_config` — the same
projection ``ensure_base`` uses — so a section this module forgot to
read cannot masquerade as a rule the catalog never had.

#: is what the guard is for, and ``test_backlog_only_shrinks`` refuses it.
#:
#: The triage is a security decision, not a mechanical one, which is why
#: it is not done here. The set contains rules that grant arbitrary code
#: execution (``npx:*``, ``pip install:*``, ``docker exec:*``,
#: ``python3:*``), raw database access the ``Dev10x:db`` skill exists to
#: route around (``psql:*``), tracker writes, and raw ``gh`` spellings
#: the skill-redirect hook deliberately steers to MCP wrappers
#: (``gh pr merge``, ``gh issue close``). Seeding those wholesale would

#: opposite of what GH-1313 is for.
