"""Permission doctor — diagnose and fix common allow-rule friction (GH-99).

Three concerns this module addresses:

1. **Duplicate-slash path typos** — ``${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`` expands with a
   trailing slash, so an expanded rule can bake a literal ``//`` into
   ``settings`` (e.g. ``.../<ver>//skills/...``); the verbatim matcher treats
   ``//`` ≠ ``/`` so the rule never matches. The fix collapses ``//`` → ``/``
   in path contexts only (GH-918) — a ``//`` inside a quoted interpreter
   expression such as ``perl -pe 's/…//g'`` is a regex delimiter and is left
   alone. Version-pinned plugin paths are deliberately NOT rewritten to ``**``
   wildcards (GH-715) — ``**`` matching is unreliable in the permission
   engine; pinned paths are kept current by
   ``dev10x permission update-paths`` on every upgrade instead.

2. **Cross-contamination** — rules referencing another project's
   absolute path (copy-paste leakage) and, in worktree CWDs, rules
   referencing the source repo by absolute path when a relative path
   inside the worktree would work.

3. **Catalog application** — load the baseline-permissions catalog
   (``baseline-permissions.yaml``, shipped alongside this module as
   package data) and apply deprecation actions (canonicalize / remove)
   plus invariant checks.

CLI entry points live under ``dev10x permission doctor``.
