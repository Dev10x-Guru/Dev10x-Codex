"""Source-derived two-axis permission manifest (GH-600).

Every pre-approval decision needs to know two things about a surface
(an MCP tool, a CLI command, or a skill): does it **read or write**, and
how **sensitive** is the data it touches. Before this module those two
axes lived apart — read/write was a token heuristic buried in
``promote.py`` and sensitivity was a command-string classifier in
``domain/sensitivity.py`` — and the curated catalog was hand-maintained,
so it rotted (camelCase tools, new CLI subcommands, own-CLI gaps).

This module is the single source for both axes. Entries are *derived*
from live sources — the MCP tool list, the ``dev10x`` Click tree, and
skill frontmatter — never hand-typed, so the manifest cannot drift
behind what the plugin actually exposes. A CI drift-check
(:func:`find_manifest_drift`) fails when a discovered surface yields no
manifest entry, extending GH-595's ``dev10x-cli`` check to every surface.

The read/write axis reuses GH-593's camelCase-aware tokenizer via
:func:`dev10x.skills.permission.promote.classify_tokens`, so a write
tool can never be misclassified as a promotable read.
