"""Report catalog rules missing from a settings file (GH-1136).

The propagation defect this module answers was invisible for months
because ``ensure-base`` reported success while writing nothing: it
filtered the rendered catalog against ``~/.claude/settings.json`` and,
once global had been seeded, found everything "already covered". The
permission engine consults the *project* file when one exists (GH-47),
so 137 of 285 shipped rules were absent from every project file while
the maintenance log read clean.

Silence was the defect, so the fix ships a way to ask the question
directly: does this settings file carry the catalog? The answer is a
count per rule family, which is what a supervisor triaging friction
needs — "38 MCP tools missing" locates the gap, whereas a flat list of
137 strings does not.

    A file that cannot be read is reported as a gap carrying the whole

    alike to a caller deciding whether to backfill.

    ``base_asks`` (GH-1154) is optional so a caller predating the ask
    tier keeps its behaviour: an omitted ask catalog reports no ask gap
    rather than reporting every ask rule as missing.

    An ask rule already covered by a ``deny`` in ``path`` is NOT reported
    missing (GH-1319): ``ensure_base_asks`` deliberately leaves such a
    rule alone (a deny is the stricter statement), so a checker that
    still counted it as missing would fail every run that writer
    correctly declined to touch. It is reported separately in
    ``skipped_denied`` instead of silently vanishing — an ask that is
    absent because a deny already covers it is not the same fact as an
    ask that is absent because nothing covers it, and this repo has been
    bitten before by a checker that could not tell "looked and found
