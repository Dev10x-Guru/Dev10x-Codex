"""Reconcile a PR's ``Fixes:``/``Closes:`` links against its commits (GH-1241).

Check 1d asks whether each linked issue's *scope* was delivered — a
reasoning judgment about titled capabilities. That judgment is the right
instrument for the hard case (a commit exists but does not deliver what
the issue titled) and the wrong one for the easy case, which is what
actually shipped wrong: PR #1228 declared six links and carried commits
for five, and GH-1221 closed with no commit behind it at all.

A link with *no* commit mentioning its ticket needs no judgment. This
module answers that half deterministically so it cannot be missed under
session-close pressure, and the judgment pass layers on top for the rest.

A wrongly-closed issue is worse than an un-merged PR: it reads as settled
and drops out of every future sweep, so the defect stays live in shipped
code with nothing tracking it.
