"""Detect raw CLI commands in skill docs that should route through MCP/Skill wrappers.

Background: skill docs (`SKILL.md`, `instructions.md`, `references/*.md`,
`references/*.yaml`) sometimes embed example commands like ``gh pr view``,
``git commit``, or ``pytest`` directly. Two failure modes follow:

1. **Permission friction** — every raw ``gh``/``git``/``pytest`` invocation
   needs a matching ``Bash(...:*)`` allow rule in front matter, otherwise
   users hit an approval prompt on every run.
2. **Guardrail bypass** — the agent reads the example and runs the raw
   command instead of the project's ``Skill(...)`` wrapper, skipping
   gitmoji/JTBD/CI-monitor/coverage gates that the wrapper enforces.

This module scans skill docs and reports each raw CLI usage with the
suggested replacement. Only fenced code blocks tagged ``bash``, ``sh``,
or ``shell`` are scanned — prose tables that *describe* what to avoid
are left alone.

Skills whose job is to *implement* the underlying operation (e.g.,
``git-commit`` implements ``git commit``) are exempt via :data:`SKILL_EXEMPTIONS`.

Two rule families sit outside the shell-fence scope above:

* :data:`PROSE_RULES` scan every doc line, because they target tool-call
  *instructions* written in prose rather than shell commands.
* A prose rule with ``scan_frontmatter=True`` additionally scans the YAML
  front matter, so an ``allowed-tools:`` grant cannot smuggle back a path the
  prose rule forbids (``retired-durable-pref-path``, GH-948).

Scope is per-rule: docs under ``skills/`` get every rule, while the repo-root
``references/`` tree gets only :data:`SHARED_DOC_RULE_IDS`.
