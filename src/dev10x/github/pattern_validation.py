"""Validate candidate review-comment patterns against recent diffs (GH-348).

Milestone-5 step for the review-bot initiative. Takes the recurring
review-comment patterns mined by
:func:`dev10x.github.review_patterns.cluster_review_comments` (GH-346)
and estimates, for each pattern, how often it would fire on recent code
changes — a heuristic false-positive proxy used to decide which patterns
are worth turning into reference rules (GH-349).

The false-positive rate here is a **heuristic estimate, not a measured
ground truth**: it assumes that a pattern firing on many more diffs than
the number of review comments that formed it is likely to over-trigger
as a rule. Treat the ``validated`` flag and ranking as guidance for
human rule authoring, not as a precise metric.

Like :mod:`dev10x.github.review_patterns`, this module is intentionally
self-contained — it fetches its own diffs via ``gh`` rather than
reaching into the miner's private helpers. It is wired as the
``validate_candidate_patterns`` MCP tool in ``github_tools.py``.

Internal functions return ``Result[T]`` per ADR-0009; the
``@server.tool()`` boundary calls ``.to_dict()``.
