"""Test runner module — invokes ``pytest`` via ``uv run`` from MCP.

Provides a structured entry point for the ``Dev10x:py-test`` skill so
the test gate works inside worktree sessions where ``pytest`` is not
on PATH and the Bash PreToolUse hook blocks every direct invocation
form (``pytest``, ``python -m pytest``, ``uv run pytest``). Because
the subprocess is launched from the MCP server, the Bash hook does
not apply (GH-238, mirrors the GH-232 ``merge_pr`` pattern).
