"""Validator: command prefix friction patterns.

Consolidates detect-and-chaining.py and block-alias-covered-commands.py.

Blocks patterns that shift the effective command prefix, breaking
allow-rule matching:
  1. && chaining with setup commands (mkdir, cd, export, etc.)
  2. ENV=value git ... prefix
  3. $(git merge-base ...) subshells
  4. git -c <key>=<value> config-override prefix (GH-488 S19 / #35/#38/#40)

# (GH-485 `--with` caveat; aligns with the fence-tool ask policy).

# GH-127 #5: head/tail set widened to catch the documented nuisance

  2. Existing git aliases:

  3. Existing Claude tools / skill scripts:
