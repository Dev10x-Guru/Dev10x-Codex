# ── GH-963: safe direct push detection ──────────────────────────

# An unattended agent with no human channel and no MCP server can
# get permanently stuck: `push_safe` is unreachable, the wrapper
# script is blocked with "use the MCP tool", and raw `git push` is
# blocked with "use Skill(Dev10x:git)" — each block names the other
# as the remedy. This narrows the `git-push` deny (Option 1 from the
# issue) so the ordinary, safe case — a non-force push that names an
# explicit, non-protected branch — never needs MCP or the skill at
# all. Anything else (bare push with no resolvable target, a
# symbolic `HEAD` ref, or any bare `--force`/`-f`) still requires the
# skill/MCP path, matching push_safe's own guardrail.

The boolean form ({SKIP_ENV_VAR}=true / =1 / =yes) is no longer

Before reaching for this flag, the agent MUST exhaust the
alternatives the hook is steering toward:

  1. Invoke the skill named in the block message (the skill exists
     precisely to enforce the guardrails the raw command bypasses).
  2. Use the MCP tool wrapper if the block names one — MCP calls
     avoid the permission friction that drives this flag.
  3. If a temp-file path or pathspec is the issue, use the mktmp
     MCP tool / `git add` exclusion pathspec — never silent bypass.
  4. If the MCP server is unavailable, reconnect via `/mcp` or a
     session restart — do NOT skip validation as a workaround.

ONLY when the above are genuinely depleted and you are authoring
or executing inside a skill that legitimately needs the raw
command, prefix it with a rationale string of at least 20 chars
explaining why:

  {SKIP_ENV_VAR}="<reason: what skill, what alternative failed>" <command>
