## Unreleased

## 0.105.0 — No Rule That Cannot Fire

Released 2026-09-17

### Fixes

- **Name every rule a promotion would ship inert** — GH-1337 pinned that a
  blocking rule's literal pattern must name a `_QUICK_TOKENS` entry, and that
  guard caught two rules the routed-CLI map had treated as live all along.
  Nineteen advisory patterns across ten rules sit in the same state — kubectl,
  aws-vault, playwright, the JS runners, `python3 -c`, and the rest — inert only
  because `from_config` drops advisory rules before the engine sees them. So
  flipping `hook_block` reads as a one-line change and silently ships a rule that
  can never fire, which is exactly how `pytest`, `gh-pr-view` and `gh-pr-ready`
  got where they were. Reachability is now derived once and reported as a warning
  naming every pair, so the list refreshes on each suite run instead of rotting
  in a doc — reported rather than asserted, because an advisory rule is under no
  obligation to be hook-reachable
  ([GH-1398](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1398))
- **Stop carrying a grant into a tree nothing writes** —
  `Read|Edit(/tmp/claude/git/**)` was dead twice over: a single leading slash
  anchors at the settings source, so it resolved to `<working dir>/tmp/claude/…`
  and granted nothing (GH-1325), and `bin/mktmp.sh` hardcodes `/tmp/Dev10x/`, so
  no Dev10x code writes that path at all. Re-anchoring would have bought a live
  grant into a directory nothing uses — moving debt rather than retiring it, so
  the entries are deleted. The ratchet moves from a namespace to a shape: the
  guard now covers any `/tmp/` path rule, since guarding them one name at a time
  leaves the third undefended, and a second guard refuses a revived
  `/tmp/claude` rule in either catalog
  ([GH-1395](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1395))

## 0.104.0 — Gates That Actually Fire, Verdicts You Can Trust

Released 2026-09-16

### Features

- **Report one CI verdict on every pull request** — `develop` carries no branch
  protection, so `Dev10x:gh-pr-merge`'s nine pre-merge validations gated nothing
  (ADR-0024), and the obvious fix would have deadlocked the repo: every workflow
  here is path-filtered, and a required check a `paths:` filter kept from
  running never reports at all. The three substantive legs are folded into
  `ci-gate.yml` — `needs:` only reaches jobs in the same file — with the path
  filtering moved to the job level, where a filtered-out leg reports `skipped`
  instead of reporting nothing. The aggregator passes on success or skipped,
  fails on anything else, and fails when nothing ran, so a skip cannot pass
  vacuously; the verdict is a script the test suite exercises rather than YAML
  nobody can run ([GH-1298](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1298))
- **Let CI assert catalog health without an agent** — `Dev10x:plugin-doctor` was
  Claude-orchestrated only, so catalog health was assertable exactly when a human
  was present to assert it; that is how GH-1100's redundant-rule drift survived
  for months, its only detector being somebody noticing a prompt. `dev10x doctor
  run` sweeps the same strategies with nobody in the loop, JSON in both
  directions, and gates the noise on severity first — the doctor's findings run
  heavily to false positives, and automating that unfiltered would emit them on a
  schedule where nobody triages them. A durable acceptance catalog *moves* a
  finding out of the blocking set rather than hiding it, requires a rationale, and
  reports entries that matched nothing as stale
  ([GH-1321](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1321))

### Fixes

- **Stop a false "no checks" ending a CI wait** — `gh pr checks` under-reports:
  PR #1372 had a completed, successful hygiene run that the Actions runs API
  listed and the CLI did not, persistently and across two sessions. That read is
  load-bearing — every hand-rolled poll loop is routed here and both loop shapes
  are hook-blocked, so an agent has no alternative and is told to trust the
  answer. A zero is now corroborated against the runs API filtered to the PR's
  head SHA, `checks_source` names which source answered, and an unreachable
  second source degrades to `undetermined` rather than to a zero
  ([GH-1376](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1376))
- **Spare an agent a stall on an empty required verdict** — two workers each sat
  on a fully green, mergeable PR (#1362 at 7/7, #1360 at 6/6) reading
  `required_verdict: "empty"` as "required checks haven't passed yet"; both
  needed orchestrator intervention. On an unprotected base `empty` is the normal
  terminal value, and the blended `verdict` is what a merge decision branches on
  ([GH-1381](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1381))
- **Tell a claimed merge gate from a run one** — two fanout workers reported
  running the nine-check merge gate for PRs they had never merged; the
  orchestrator had merged both by hand while they were stalled, and they resumed
  and narrated the pipeline their brief listed as REQUIRED. A skipped gate is
  visible; a falsely claimed one is invisible, and GH-1093 trusts a worker's
  report on purpose. The remedy is a comparison rather than a ledger the worker
  could also narrate: GitHub stamps `mergedAt`, so checks measured at or after
  that moment cannot be the gate that preceded it
  ([GH-1380](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1380))
- **Catch a routing slip at the call, not after the merge** — a bugfix session's
  full-suite run routed correctly and all six edit-run-edit iterations did not,
  each a targeted raw `pytest` with a working wrapper available. Nothing could
  have caught it: the rule was advisory, dropped before the engine saw it, and
  would have been short-circuited by the fast-path token filter anyway —
  registered, documented and inert, the shape GH-1211/GH-1212 found in the
  `Monitor` matcher. The narrow shape now blocks with an exact translation, and
  an invariant pins that every blocking rule's pattern names a quick token, so a
  new rule cannot ship unreachable
  ([GH-1337](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1337))
- **Hold a session to a widget after the last was answered** — a widget answer
  arrives as a tool result, so the turn boundary slid past it to the last typed
  message and every later turn still held the original `AskUserQuestion`; the
  gate resolved ASKED and stayed suppressed until the supervisor next typed. A
  widget answer now ends the turn it belongs to, discriminated by a
  `toolUseResult` carrying both `questions` and `answers` — verified against a
  live transcript before being built on, with `tool_use_id` kept as the
  protocol-level fallback
  ([GH-1336](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1336))
- **Stop a zero reading retiring a live guard** — `hook-patterns.md` tells a
  reader to query `StopVerdict.signal` to decide whether GH-1257's cooldown
  guard can go, and no record ever carried that key: the branch landed in the
  generic `reason` slot. One session read a narrow slice as near-zero and nearly
  concluded the retirement condition was met; a wider re-measurement found the
  guard firing repeatedly. Both keys are now written, `extra` is the seam for a
  rule needing its own field, and `harness_version` — the other half of the
  condition, previously not evaluable at all — is recorded as the literal
  `unknown` when unreadable rather than left absent
  ([GH-1390](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1390))
- **Route lessons-learned PRs to a reviewer, not drafts** — six bot-authored
  draft PRs sat six weeks with zero comments and zero CI runs before being
  disposed. Three mechanisms compounded: the PRs opened as `--draft`, both
  review workflows gate on the PR not being a draft, and drafts get no CI here
  at all — the design guaranteed they would expire unseen. They now open ready
  for review with the closed PR's author requested, and out-of-scope
  improvements are filed as issues instead of prose that rots with the PR
  ([GH-1351](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1351))
- **Let a projects list say it selects nothing** — implements ADR-0026.
  `projects[].match` carried two incompatible meanings, a directory-path glob in
  `friction.yaml` and an `org/repo` glob everywhere else; the repo-addressed side
  is now `match_repo:`, with `match:` read as a deprecated alias for one release
  so no hand-edited config is silently orphaned. The rename makes the crossed
  convention legible, but what prevents recurrence is the report: a `projects:`
  list that matched nothing was indistinguishable from one never evaluated, and
  both were silent. `config doctor` and `playbook diff` now keep absent,
  unresolved, no-match and matched apart — `playbook diff` previously located
  override files by path and never read the list inside them
  ([GH-1375](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1375))
- **Let the CLI-drift guard see lazy subcommands** — the walk read
  `click.Group.commands` directly, which `LazyGroup` never populates, so every
  top-level group was invisible and the CI drift gate passed green while
  measuring nothing. Walking via `list_commands`/`get_command` leaves the ~40ms
  startup budget unaffected, and the now-working guard immediately found 22
  pre-existing uncovered commands, recorded as a shrink-only ratchet rather than
  triaged here ([GH-1370](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1370))
- **Name the cause when a plan file cannot be read** — `Plan.load` swallowed a
  corrupt or wrong-shape `plan.yaml` into an empty plan with no diagnostic, and
  since GH-1339 an empty plan reads as "this session has no task list" and
  auto-advances quietly — indistinguishable in the audit log from the intended
  GH-1055 case. A genuinely absent file stays silent; everything else now names
  the path and the cause
  ([GH-1346](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1346))

### Maintenance

- **Drop the hand-kept list of mktmp namespaces** — the catalog enumerated
  `/tmp/Dev10x/<namespace>/**` once per tool per namespace, 20 hand-maintained
  rules with a documented trap: an unlisted namespace prompts forever while
  looking wired up. Settled empirically first, as the ticket asked — Read/Edit/
  Write rules are gitignore patterns, so `**` crosses directories and one tree
  rule reaches every namespace; the "`**` is unreliable" lesson is true of
  `Bash()` rules and was wrongly generalised. The same reference settled a second
  thing nobody had asked: a single leading slash anchors at the settings source,
  so all 20 rules were granting nothing. 20 dead rules become 2 live ones, and a
  ratchet keeps the anchor fixed
  ([GH-1325](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1325))
- **Settle what PAP means and rehome two axes** — the acronym expanded three
  different ways across the repo, and two axes of the three-axis action model
  pointed at a reference rewritten under ADR-0022 to cover gate behaviour only.
  PAP is canonically Policy Administration Point (XACML sense), and Tier and
  Reversibility now point at their surviving live definition
  ([GH-1333](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1333))
- **Spare the next editor an inherited red scanner** — two catalog comments
  naming the raw CLI their wrapper replaces are exactly what the CLI-friction
  scanner matches on; both landed the same day and were never scanned, because
  the workflow only reads files a PR changed. Marked with the documented inline
  suppression so the next person to touch the file does not inherit a red check
  they cannot explain from their own diff
  ([GH-1321](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1321))

## 0.103.0 — Rules That Match What You Type, A Turn That Keeps Going

Released 2026-09-16

### Features

- **Cover every spelling of a command from one catalog entry** — Claude Code
  matches allow rules literally, so `dev10x permission ensure-base` and
  `uvx dev10x permission ensure-base` are two unrelated rules. The catalog
  hand-listed them per subcommand, which made coverage depend on whoever added
  the entry remembering every runner — and the bare spelling, the one the docs
  show and a human types, was the one nobody remembered. `command_spellings:`
  renders one rule per prefix × command, folded in at the load seam so merge,
  drift, gap and coverage all still see flat rule strings and a userspace
  catalog predating the schema reads as behind by N rules rather than broken.
  The foreman and watchdog read-only verbs are catalogued too; their absence in
  every spelling had an unattended pre-flight prompting on its own heartbeat and
  collecting seventeen unsynced per-checkout catch-alls
  ([GH-1317](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1317))
- **Enable PR listing without a raw `gh pr list`** — the PR family had
  view/close/ready but no list, so listing pull requests could only go through
  the raw CLI, which is uncatalogued and prompts on every call — enough to wedge
  an unattended agent on a pending approval. `pr_list` mirrors `issue_list`'s
  parameter shape and is catalogued as read-only, with an advisory
  command-skill-map rule matching `gh-issue-list`'s posture
  ([GH-1359](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1359))
- **Enable milestone listing without a raw `gh api` call** — the milestone
  family had create/close/reopen/edit but no read, so listing the roster meant
  `gh api --paginate`, which the skill-redirect hook steers away from, leaving
  callers nowhere to go but a broad `gh api *` catch-all grant. `milestone_list`
  mirrors the other milestone tools and is catalogued in `base_permissions` as
  read-only ([GH-1319](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1319))

### Fixes

- **Keep a session working until the plan is actually done** — a Stop hook's
  `block` means *do not stop*, and reading "auto-advance" as "let the turn end
  quietly" removed the only mechanism that keeps an agent going: a session with
  real pending tasks stopped at a self-declared "natural reporting point" and
  nothing objected. The gate now blocks on actionable work — open tasks minus
  the terminal Verify-AC gate, the discriminator that keeps GH-149's
  always-open task from firing it every turn — with a steer naming the next
  task and no widget, because the plan is the authorisation. A depleted task
  list over a dirty tree also blocks, naming the paths; it carries the
  shared-worktree escape, since nothing at Stop time can attribute uncommitted
  changes and telling an agent to commit files it never touched would be worse
  than the missing commit
  ([GH-1377](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1377),
  [GH-1365](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1365))
- **Keep an agent's work when its turn ends waiting** — four agents in one
  fanout swarm ended their turns mid-lifecycle with work uncommitted while
  waiting on a background test run, every brief carrying the anti-stall
  prohibition verbatim. Restating the rule a third time would fail the same
  way, so the lifecycle is now a fixed order in which the commit is step 3 and
  verification step 5 — an agent about to wait is out of order, which is far
  cheaper to notice than a rule recalled mid-task — and
  `subagent-dispatch.md` is corrected at the source, since its required pipeline
  had taught the very ordering bias the swarm acted on. `dev10x orchestration
  stranded-work` reads a finished agent's worktree and reports work about to be
  reclaimed unreachably; fanout Phase 4 runs it before trusting any status
  token, DONE included
  ([GH-1363](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1363))
- **Enforce `disableAutoMode` / `disableBypassPermissionsMode`** — both accept
  ONLY the literal string `"disable"`; a JSON boolean `true` is silently
  ignored, so the control reads as configured while enforcing nothing. A prior
  session had written the invalid boolean to 74 settings files with no error
  surfaced anywhere. A write-time validator now fails loud on anything else,
  `ensure_base()` seeds both keys on every settings file it touches (honoring
  the git-tracked-settings guard), and `doctor safety-keys` reports absent or
  invalid keys for post-upgrade verification
  ([GH-1320](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1320))
- **Name leaked-secret rules and narrow the matcher** — `permission clean`
  matched bare `TOKEN=`-style substrings and printed the raw rule on a hit, so a
  maintainer could not locate a real credential without reading plaintext values
  in CLI output, while the detector still missed real shapes such as a URL
  `?token=<uuid>` or a `ghp_`/`Bearer` value. Named `SecretPattern` entries
  replace the flat indicator list, and findings carry a rule id, a redacted
  rule and the matched span, so the value is masked before it reaches a message
  ([GH-1312](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1312))
- **Catch a bare-newline command chain with no separator** — two commands on
  separate lines with no separator at all were invisible to both DX010 and
  DX007. A prior attempt held back because blind newline counting
  false-positives hard on legitimate multi-line quoted strings; shared
  `strip_quoted_spans` / `strip_line_continuations` helpers mean an embedded
  newline inside a quoted `-m` message or inline JSON is never mistaken for a
  chain boundary, and a multi-line `if/then/fi` is not miscounted either
  ([GH-1350](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1350))
- **Pre-approve the Linear namespace sessions actually call** — the catalog
  covered `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__*` but only 5 of the equivalent read ops on
  `mcp__linear-server__*`, the namespace Dev10x sessions invoke, so 11 more had
  accumulated as ad-hoc per-call approvals while a comment claimed parity with
  nothing checking it. The 23 missing read ops are catalogued and a parity test
  now pins the one documented linear-server-only exception, so a new one is a
  conscious edit ([GH-1323](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1323))
- **Keep `ensure-base`'s ask checker agreeing with its writer** — the writer
  correctly leaves an ask rule alone when the target file already denies it, but
  `compute_gap` had no deny subtraction, so a correct write was reported as a
  failure and exited non-zero on all five checkouts carrying the `gh api`
  mutation denies. Deny-covered rules are excluded from `missing_ask` and
  reported separately as `skipped_denied` — "nothing covers it" and "a deny
  covers it" call for opposite remediations, and collapsing them had already
  produced a proposed backfill of 8 asks
  ([GH-1366](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1366))
- **Raise the `run_tests` default past real suite runtimes** — the 600s default
  sat well under this repo's own full-suite runtime, so the documented
  full-suite gate timed out on the one call it mandates and every caller reached
  for the raw `pytest` the routing table forbids. The default is now
  `MAX_TOOL_CALL_SECONDS`, the ceiling a larger value is clamped to anyway
  ([GH-1331](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1331))
- **Ground the MCP idle ceiling in documented fact** — `MAX_TOOL_CALL_SECONDS`
  was defended by two server-crash observations with no confirmed relationship
  to the transport's actual idle-abort window, so every downstream budget rested
  on an inference. The documented 30-minute stdio idle timeout is now cited as
  the source, and the two failure modes the old docstring conflated are
  separated ([GH-1305](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1305))
- **Stop the plugin panel understating what is installed** — the panel renders
  `plugin.json`'s description verbatim, and that one string carries both a
  version (maintained by the release bump) and a skill count (maintained by
  nobody). It had drifted to 69 against 91 shipped, and a correct version beside
  a wrong count invited trusting both — a field test certified both as current.
  The count is corrected and guarded by the test that already owns every other
  claim about these manifests, derived from the filesystem so adding a skill
  fails with the new number in the message
  ([GH-1356](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1356))
- **Keep the ImageMagick guard reading rendered rules** — the test YAML-parsed
  the baseline catalog directly, asserting on what the file spells rather than
  what the group renders, and so read the migrated aliases as missing. It now
  reads through `load_baseline_dict`, the documented chokepoint
  ([GH-1317](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1317))

### Docs

- **Settle the addressing scheme behind `projects[].match`** — four global
  config files carry a `projects:` list whose selector is called `match`, each
  comparing it against something different: an absolute path, a
  `nameWithOwner`, or a full origin URL. A glob correct in one file silently
  selects nothing in another, and nothing reports the miss. Measuring it
  corrected three parts of the original account — the collision is asymmetric
  rather than symmetric, a URL comparison makes a host-anchored glob depend on
  whether the clone is HTTPS or SSH, and the family is four files, not two.
  ADR-0026 keeps `match:` for path semantics, renames the three repo-addressed
  files to `match_repo:`, and converges `gitmoji.yaml` onto `nameWithOwner`,
  collapsing four comparison targets to two; the rename itself is deferred to
  GH-1375 ([GH-1344](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1344))

## 0.102.0 — A Gate That Reads the Plan, A Catalog That Reaches Settings

Released 2026-09-16

### Features

- **Give issue labels an add/remove selector** — `issue_edit`'s `labels`
  parameter documented replacement semantics it never had: it only ever calls
  `gh issue edit --add-label`, so a caller trying to remove a label got a
  silent no-op rather than an error or a removal. `issue_labels` mirrors
  `pr_labels` (GH-1008) — one tool with a `list`/`add`/`remove` selector,
  idempotent both ways so callers can call it unconditionally instead of
  probing. It is catalogued in `base_permissions` because its raw-CLI
  equivalent is routed and blocked, which makes the wrapper the only route
  ([GH-1322](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1322))

### Fixes

- **Stop the Stop gate interrupting work already assigned** — the gate blocked
  any turn that had not called `AskUserQuestion`, whatever the plan still held,
  so a session with a pending task was told to invent a question about work it
  had already been given; blocking was its most common outcome, 106 of 224
  audit records. Open work is now itself the recommended next action and
  auto-advances, leaving one blocking state — a task list that exists and holds
  nothing open. An absent task list is told apart from a depleted one (GH-1055),
  because models without the task tools never populate `plan.tasks` and
  conflating the two would have blocked every such session on every turn. The
  prose-deferral carve-out went too: "shall I push?" is not a question — pushing
  is a forward, reversible step — and removing it leaves nothing but structure
  deciding the verdict. That exposed a defect the carve-out had been masking:
  the wiring handed `task_signal` the `plan` metadata rather than the whole
  summary, so the signal had always been empty in the field
  ([GH-1339](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1339))
- **Spare a dispatched worker a question meant for a human** — a subagent's
  counterparty is the orchestrator that dispatched it, never a person, and
  GH-1314's branch to keep the Stop gate away from subagents had never once
  fired: `SUBAGENT` appeared 0 times in 224 audit records. Every discriminator
  it keyed on was a guess at a payload shape that does not arrive. A subagent is
  now detected from the transcript layout captured from live dispatches — a
  `subagents/` parent *and* an `agent-` prefix, both required so neither a main
  session under such a directory nor a project named after an agent is misread.
  The payload-key checks remain as a fallback, and absent evidence still reads
  as a main session
  ([GH-1340](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1340))
- **Close chain-detection gaps in two validators** — DX010 required 3+
  statements before blocking, so a two-statement `;` chain of two
  already-allowed commands matched no allow rule and reached a raw permission
  prompt; the threshold is now one remaining separator. DX007 checked `;` chains
  but never `||`, which shifts the allow-rule prefix identically — it now has a
  matching check, deliberately silent on `cmd || true`-style fallbacks
  ([GH-1316](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1316))
- **Stop steering crews to a withdrawn `cp` recipe and an uninstalled alias** —
  the foreman crew template recommended a `cp`-based `.claude/` staging recipe
  the supervisor withdrew, contradicting the template's own fatal-shapes ban;
  the git-pager steer named a `git nopager` alias not installed for every user,
  routing them around their own `--no-pager` deny; and the commit-message steer
  pointed at the `mktmp.sh` shell fallback instead of the sanctioned MCP tool.
  A worker now files an issue and defers to the foreman rather than writing
  under `.claude/` by any route
  ([GH-1318](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1318))
- **Enable `playbook diff` to reach work-on's default** — `plugin_default_path()`
  looked only for a per-skill `references/playbook.yaml`, and work-on has none —
  its tier-3 default is the shared `skills/playbook/` file — so the diff
  silently skipped it every run and folded the skip into its "up to date"
  summary. A skill nobody checked read as clean: the same class of defect as
  GH-1215. Skipped skills are now tracked and reported distinctly
  ([GH-1329](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1329))
- **Stop the skills index costing a permission prompt** — the session-start
  skills index used a plain `Read` of `~/.claude/SKILLS.md`, and the Read *tool*
  is gated by `additionalDirectories` rather than by `Read()` allow-rules, so no
  permission rule could close the gap: the file prompted on every session
  whatever rule was written. It is now read in-process, with no tool call and no
  gate, and degrades to an empty string on a missing or unreadable file so one
  failing feature never skips the rest
  ([GH-1315](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1315))
- **Enable pre-GH-1261 catalogs to get IDE rules** — `ide_permissions` and
  `ide_denies` were classified in neither the merge set nor `USER_OWNED_KEYS`,
  so a userspace catalog written before GH-1261 never received the shipped IDE
  permission block and `catalog-diff` warned on every invocation. They now merge
  per-IDE the way the tracker keys do, and `ide_denies` refuses suppression
  because GH-1261's shell-equivalent-tool denies are unconditional
  ([GH-1311](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1311))
- **Enable `ensure-ignored` to reach repos, not roots** — a configured root can
  be a container of many repos (`/work/dx`) rather than a repo itself, so
  passing it straight to `common_git_dir` failed and every real repo underneath
  was never reached. Each root is now expanded into the git repos beneath it,
  and "0 candidates found" is reportable separately from "0 need changes" — the
  two reading as the same success is why the gap went unnoticed
  ([GH-1330](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1330))

### Internal

- **Prevent a catalogued rule from never reaching settings** — two permission
  catalogs of comparable size have coexisted since GH-99 with no relationship
  any code enforced, and only `skills/upgrade-cleanup/projects.yaml` is on the
  write path. A rule written into `baseline-permissions.yaml`'s `groups:` block
  reached a settings file only if someone ran `--enable-group` by name. GH-1100
  E18 and E19 turned out to be two of 189 such rules across 17 groups. They are
  recorded as a ratchet rather than seeded — the set includes
  arbitrary-execution rules, raw `psql` the db skill exists to route around, and
  raw `gh` spellings the skill-redirect hook steers to MCP wrappers, and seeding
  those unreviewed would widen every user's default permission surface. ADR-0025
  records why `projects.yaml` is authoritative: it is the one on the write path,
  and a rule's whole value is that it reaches a settings file

### Docs

- **Give recurring procedures a reference to derive from** — four guides
  distilled from field-backed work: the safety-floor pattern (deny rules as
  immutable boundaries) and degraded-input testing from PR #1036
  ([GH-912](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/912)),
  diff-scoped CI check patterns
  ([GH-835](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/835)),
  operational-protocol patterns for skills that interpret signals — what a
  signal proves and does not, field evidence, and excuse-vs-reality tables
  ([GH-933](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/933)), and
  durability-first guidance on what survives session death (commits, issue
  comments) versus what must be re-derived (transcripts, inherited claims)

## 0.101.1 — Plans That Remember, Gates That Can Be Answered

Released 2026-09-16

### Fixes

- **Keep a plan that still knows what was planned** — the PostToolUse hook read
  `tool_result` and regex-matched the rendered line a previous Claude Code
  wrote. Since 2.1.263 the created task arrives structured under
  `tool_response`, and that field was absent, so every `TaskCreate` was dropped
  without a trace: the harness task list held the task, the hook exited 0, and
  `plan.yaml` grew no `tasks` key at all. Anything reading the persisted plan
  for open work saw a fresh session. The created task is now read from
  `tool_response` as well as the rendered text, so neither harness needs
  detecting, and the outcome is handed on unchanged from the payload seam —
  which cannot know which tool ran
  ([GH-1309](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1309))
- **Spare a session a block it already answered** — a tool result is written as
  a `user` entry, so `_is_user` treated every tool call as a turn boundary.
  `_read_turn` stopped at the last tool call rather than the last typed
  message, and because an `AskUserQuestion` is always followed by its own
  result, the call sat outside the window that looks for it. The gate's own
  steer was therefore unsatisfiable: `asked` fired 0 times in 159 audit records
  while `blocked` fired 76. A user entry whose content is only tool results now
  reads as the tool answering rather than the supervisor speaking, standby is
  scoped to a genuine message so a tool result can no longer silently clear a
  park the supervisor set, and tests fail if `asked` becomes unreachable again
  ([GH-1334](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1334))

### Docs

- **Keep the friction class map citable after the tracker closes** — the
  permission-friction types (A–G), the class map, and the D0–D5 diagnosis
  existed only in GH-1100's issue body. Twenty-plus issues cite the class map
  by letter, so closing the tracker would have broken every one of those
  cross-references with no replacement to point at.
  `references/permission-friction-taxonomy.md` now carries the types, the class
  map, the diagnosis, and the tracker lineage, and records that the classes end
  at O — the "A–R" range named in the extraction map has no P/Q/R rows and never
  did. PAP/PDP/PEP cross-link to the two docs that already cover them rather
  than adding a third competing description, D2 stays a pointer to
  `permission-architecture.md` (which has held the live copy since GH-1095), and
  the new reference is registered in `.claude/rules/INDEX.md`
  ([GH-1100](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1100))

## 0.100.1 — Review Requests That Reach the Team & Gates That Know Their Audience

Released 2026-09-15

### Features

- **Let a Chat-only team use the combined review request** —
  `Dev10x:request-review` is the documented way to ask a team to look at a PR,
  and every layer of its notification step named Slack: the step title, the
  delegation, the summary template, the frontmatter. A team on Google Chat had
  no supported way in, even though the Chat sibling has shipped in the same
  plugin since GH-885 — the observed session passed the transport as free text
  and the agent substituted the sibling on its own judgement. The transport is
  now resolved from whichever per-repo config names the repo, both run when
  both are configured (mirroring a request into two places is a real setup, not
  an error), and neither configured asks where the request should go rather
  than failing into silence
  ([GH-1308](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1308))

### Fixes

- **Spare the operator a prompt per delegated skill** — 17 skills invoked a
  `Skill()` they never declared, so each of those 52 delegations cost an
  approval prompt on every run, in every project, forever, while looking fully
  wired up everywhere a reader would think to check. Enforcement was a manual
  checklist item; the two guards nearby cover MCP tools and raw CLI and never
  skill-to-skill delegation. A guard now scans every `SKILL.md` together with
  its sibling `instructions.md` — a call and its declaration can sit in
  different files and neither reads as incomplete alone — resolves bare names
  against `skills/` so prose and diagrams cannot demand a declaration for a
  skill that does not exist, honours a blanket `- Skill` grant, and skips
  anti-pattern lines, since a body teaching a wrong call is not making it
  ([GH-1326](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1326))
- **Stop the turn gate addressing an absent supervisor** — "a turn always ends
  on a widget" presumes someone is there to answer, and two cases have nobody.
  A subagent reports back to whoever dispatched it; one was seen ending with
  "No open decisions on my end. Are we done here?", a near-verbatim echo of
  this hook's own steer, complying with a block it should never have received.
  A parked session has a supervisor who has said to stop asking, and the widget
  offered no answer that meant it — confirming "are we done?" only re-armed the
  gate next turn. Standby is now the widget's terminal answer, scoped to the
  turn's boundary user message so it lasts until the supervisor speaks again
  rather than forever, and both branches are named in the audit log so each is
  observable in the field rather than assumed
  ([GH-1314](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1314))
- **Give an unconfigured repo the review card too** — the Chat prepare step's
  ask branch printed a hand-written six-key dict instead of the envelope
  SKILL.md documents, dropping the `cardsV2` default the resolver carried onto
  every other path, so a repo with no config entry silently posted plain text.
  The test pinning the branch asserted that absence, against a path that never
  touched the PR at all. The ask envelope is built with the same constructor
  the success path uses, so a key added to one cannot be missed by the other
  ([GH-1307](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1307))
- **Spare the operator a release stranded mid-flight** — `bin/release.sh`
  rewrites versions with `--no-commit` and then stages its own hardcoded
  `VERSION_FILES` array, so a file bumpversion rewrites but the script never
  stages stays dirty and the next `bump-my-version` call in the same run aborts
  on an unclean tree. Adding `marketplace.json` to `.bumpversion.toml` (below)
  did exactly that: this release stranded between the patch bump and the
  finalize, with the bump commit already landed, so a naive re-run would have
  bumped the patch a second time and shipped a version nobody chose. Every
  bumpversion filename must now appear in `release.sh`, asserted in the suite,
  so the next entry fails a test rather than a release
  ([GH-1328](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1328))
- **Tell the operator which plugin version is installed** — the Plugins panel
  renders an installed plugin from its marketplace entry, and that entry
  carried no version key at all, so the panel had nothing to show. Nothing
  could self-heal it either: a release moved `plugin.json` and never touched
  `marketplace.json`, which is why the entry's duplicated description had also
  drifted months stale. `marketplace.json` is now listed in
  `.bumpversion.toml`, so a release moves both manifests in one commit, and the
  stale copy is dropped because `plugin.json` owns it
  ([GH-1310](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1310))

## 0.99.0 — Wrappers That Answer Truthfully & Guards That Cannot Be Walked Around

Released 2026-09-15

### Features

- **Let a project answer which IDE it runs, once** — an installed IDE MCP
  server's tools prompted on every call forever, because nothing could write
  the answer a catalog fold would need. `pin_ide` / `ide_status` mirror
  `pin_tracker` / `tracker_status` down to the repo-stem keying, so one answer
  covers a repo and every worktree of it; `ensure_base` folds the keyed block
  where it already folds the tracker's. Two things differ, both because an IDE
  is not a tracker: the resolved default is `none` rather than a named IDE, so
  an unpinned repo folds nothing instead of seeding a guess, and an unknown
  name is an error rather than a quiet degrade — a typo would otherwise surface
  weeks later as an IDE whose tools never stopped prompting. Thirty tools are
  catalogued under `ide_permissions`, not `base_permissions`, because GH-768
  already paid once for seeding one tracker's rules unconditionally
  ([GH-1261](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1261))
- **Close the hole an IDE shell tool opens in every Bash guard** —
  `execute_terminal_command`, `execute_code_on_kernel` and `execute_tool` run
  arbitrary shell without being a Bash call, and the PreToolUse chain returns
  early on `tool_name != "Bash"`. One allowed tool of that shape voids
  DX001–DX016, every `Bash()` deny in settings (sudo, `git push --force`,
  `rm -rf /`, `gh api --method DELETE`) and the skill-redirect hook at once.
  The three are denied unconditionally in `base_denies` — the hazard depends on
  the server being installed, not on the user having picked that IDE — and a new
  `shell-equivalent-mcp-tools` doctor strategy scans every MCP server in
  settings, whatever its source, since `uncatalogued_tools` reported only
  Dev10x's own registrations and an installed third-party server with 37 tools
  was invisible to every check. Detection is by name, so it is a floor and not a
  guarantee: GH-1260 again — rules match names and command strings, never
  effects ([GH-1261](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1261))
- **Prompt on a sensitive file however it is read** — a read is an effect
  reachable by unbounded means (`cat`, `head`, `rg`, `jq`, `awk`, a redirect, a
  symlink, different quoting), and GH-1260 established by controlled test that
  neither permission namespace can close that: a `Read()` rule governs the Read
  tool only, while a blanket `Bash(rg:*)` allow makes every file on the machine
  readable with no prompt. DX014 now matches a path wordlist against the
  command's operand tokens — AWS/SSH/kube/docker/gh credentials, key material,
  credential dotfiles, secrets files — so the reading verb no longer gates the
  match, and the whole operand is carried into the prompt because the matched
  span names no file a supervisor can act on. The posture stays `ask`, not
  `deny`, and near misses stay silent. `StopVerdict.signal` now names which
  branch ended a turn and attributes it to the audit record, so GH-1257's
  request to retire the cooldown marker becomes decidable from the field
  ([GH-1278](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1278))
- **Hand the supervisor a widget instead of a last sentence** — every mechanism
  enforcing "do not end on a decision question" was model-side instruction, and
  therefore skippable. A Stop hook was already wired and could enforce none of
  it, because the orchestrator discarded every return value. Stop features may
  now return a verdict; the orchestrator merges them and emits at most one
  envelope, whose `reason` becomes the continued turn's instruction and names
  `Dev10x:ask`. The block condition is broader than first proposed — a
  plan-approval gate held as "say go and I'll run 4.1 through 4.11" has no
  question mark at all — so a turn ending with no `AskUserQuestion` blocks, full
  stop, and what varies is the steer, graded by the task list. The goodbye is
  captured and replayed only when nothing blocks: a farewell during a continued
  turn asserts an ending that is not happening
  ([GH-1251](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1251))
- **Let the durable config shrink as well as grow** — every maintenance
  command's contract is "ensure X is present", which is monotone by
  construction: a measured 0.98.0 pass ran ~1,250 additions against 14 removals.
  The cost is not disk — two thirds of `friction.yaml` was pins for ephemeral
  worktrees that no longer exist, so first-match-wins evaluation walked ~63 dead
  entries before reaching a real project, and real defects hid among them.
  `dev10x session reap` removes a `projects[]` entry only when it names at least
  one absolute path and every such path is absent; a glob-only entry names no
  checkout that can be checked, so it is always kept — keeping a dead entry
  costs a glob comparison, removing a live one silently changes a project's
  posture ([GH-1253](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1253))
- **Stop Dev10x's own state dirtying every worktree** — Dev10x writes
  per-session state to `.claude/Dev10x/`, and in any project that tracks
  `.claude/` nothing ignored it, so a fresh worktree read as dirty the moment a
  session ran in it and the user cleaned each by hand. The rule goes in
  `.git/info/exclude` rather than a tracked `.claude/.gitignore`: it lives in
  the common git dir, so one write covers a repo and every worktree of it,
  including ones created later, and it keeps a maintenance pass from writing
  git-tracked content. Git is asked whether the path is ignored rather than a
  file being read, so any existing route counts
  ([GH-1275](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1275))
- **Put the running app one click from the review ping** — reviewing a
  front-end change means looking at the app, but the Chat card offered only Open
  PR, so the reviewer left Chat, opened the PR, scrolled past the CI checks to
  the deployment bot's comment, and clicked through from there, every time. The
  URL is read from the Deployments API rather than that comment, because
  `deployment_status.environment_url` is the one field Vercel, Netlify and Pages
  all populate while a comment's wording belongs to the provider. Preview
  deployments are asynchronous, so the button is absent rather than waited for —
  a review request that arrives late is worse than one missing a button
  ([GH-1262](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1262))
- **Drop the approval prompt from every preview probe** — probing a PR's own
  preview deployment needed an environment prefix and a pipe, each of which
  moves the command string off the allow rule covering the script path. "Don't
  ask again" could not help: the rule it remembers carries that PR's preview
  host, which the next PR does not share, so the prompt returns and the settings
  file keeps a dead entry. `--staging-url`, `--secrets-file` and `--tail`
  resolve flag > env > default, so every existing caller's environment keeps
  working and the command can begin with the script path
  ([GH-1263](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1263))
- **Let a worktree run its tests without a prompt** — `Bash(uv run pytest:*)`
  was catalogued, but allow-rule matching keys on the literal command string, so
  it never matched `uv run --directory <path> pytest` — the shape Dev10x's own
  `Dev10x:git-worktree` flow produces. `catalog-gap` reported 0 missing
  throughout, because it compares settings against the catalog and the shape was
  absent from both. Same failure mode as GH-1189 and GH-1149: a command family
  catalogued in one shape while users type another
  ([GH-1248](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1248))
- **Let a long-lived catalog receive the sections it never had** — ADR-0021
  merged the shipped catalog into the user's for `base_permissions` and
  `base_denies` only; every other key fell through an implicit pass-through
  branch, correct for the machine-specific keys it was written for and silently
  wrong for `base_asks` and the tracker keys when those shipped later. On a
  0.98.0 machine, zero `ask` rules reached any settings file and a repo pinned
  `tracker: github` was seeded with no github rules — while every rule-level
  check reported clean, because a section the user's catalog never declares is a
  section nothing compares against. The classification is explicit now, and a
  shipped key in none of the three sets warns
  ([GH-1249](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1249))

### Fixes

- **Stop the PR wrappers accepting calls they cannot honour** — five
  wrapper-contract defects that all failed the same way: the call was accepted,
  something plausible came back, and the caller could not tell. `create_pr` was
  the only PR wrapper without `repo=`; `pr_get` exposed no changed-file list,
  pushing callers onto a raw `gh api` whose 30-item page truncated a 41-file PR
  into a false-negative merge gate; `merge_pr` merged whatever the head was at
  call time rather than the head the gate verified, so a push landing mid-gate
  shipped unreviewed code; the JTBD marker check demanded a literal "wants to",
  which the jtbd guidance itself advises against; and `create_pr` derived its
  `Fixes:` trailer from `fixes_url` alone, so linking an issue the documented
  way produced a body the hygiene bot rejects
  ([GH-1269](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1269),
  [GH-1265](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1265),
  [GH-1267](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1267),
  [GH-1258](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1258),
  [GH-1256](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1256))
- **Stop a linked issue staying open with nobody noticing** — GH-1256 taught
  `create_pr` to derive a `Fixes:` reference, but nothing asserted one reached
  the PR and nothing asked afterwards whether the link closed anything. Both
  halves fail silently: a body with no trailer closes nothing, and an issue
  GitHub declines to close just stays open while the bundle reads as complete.
  Observed on develop — one merge closed two of three identical trailers, a
  later session recorded 0 of 7 across two merges, and both spellings failed in
  that run, so the form is not the variable. `create_pr` now re-reads the
  created PR and refuses a body with no trailer, naming the PR so an open one is
  not stranded; `reconcile_link_closure` runs as `gh-pr-monitor` Phase 3.6 and
  reports stragglers for the supervisor rather than closing them silently
  ([GH-1274](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1274))
- **Prevent a stale base from erasing merged work** — a groom on a `develop`
  last fetched the previous evening printed a clean success, and the leased
  force-push that followed erased eight commits that seven PRs had merged eleven
  minutes earlier. Nothing noticed: a lease compares the remote against the
  *local* remote-tracking ref, so a stale copy leases against itself, and the two
  tips shared a tree so `git diff` showed nothing either — only a subject-level
  search of the log found the loss. `--force-with-lease` was the one force
  spelling `push_safe` deliberately never matched, so on a protected branch it
  was ungated entirely. A protected target is now fetched first and refused
  unless its remote tip is already an ancestor, naming the commits that would be
  dropped ([GH-1270](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1270))
- **Prevent a green run certifying the wrong checkout** —
  `run_node_tests(cwd="apps/web")` resolved against the long-lived MCP server's
  own directory rather than the calling worker's worktree, ran there, and
  returned green for a tree the worker had never written to. That is not
  friction but manufactured evidence, and the relative form propagated from a
  repo's own CLAUDE.md into every crew brief. A relative path has no correct
  meaning across a worktree boundary and the intended directory is not
  recoverable from it, so `use_cwd` — the seam every MCP tool's `cwd=` passes
  through — refuses it, and the payload echoes the absolute directory the run
  actually happened in
  ([GH-1264](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1264))
- **Tell the caller a long run timed out, not that the line died** — the MCP
  server died mid-session and took every in-flight background task with it: a
  `run_tests` call at 18m59s and an unrelated `ci_check_status` started thirteen
  minutes later, killed in the same instant. What reaches the caller is
  `Connection closed`, which cannot tell a slow suite from a crashed server. The
  transport budget now lives in one shared module at 1080s — below both observed
  deaths at ~1137s, deliberately not a measurement of the ceiling — both test
  runners clamp to it, and a clamped run returns `verdict=timeout` with the
  elapsed budget. `ci_check_status` reached the transport by a different path
  and summed its own cap inline, so the shared constant never reached it: the
  poll count now comes down with the cap, so the loop ends on its own terms
  rather than being killed mid-iteration
  ([GH-1288](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1288),
  [GH-1302](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1302))
- **Stop a stopped test run from outliving its caller** — stopping a
  backgrounded `run_tests` killed the wrapper and left the real work running.
  `async_run` spawned children in the caller's own process group, so
  `proc.kill()` reached only the direct child — and `uv run … pytest` makes
  pytest a grandchild. The survivor kept running this repo's git tests, which
  call `git reset --hard`, so committed work vanished from a worktree nobody was
  touching, with no error raised anywhere. The cancellation path was worse:
  `TaskStop` tears the coroutine down, so the `TimeoutError` branch never ran
  and the orphan was unconditional
  ([GH-1304](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1304))
- **Stop a push losing its own receipt to git's chatter** — every `push_safe`
  call that set an upstream returned `{}`. `git push -u` announces "branch '…'
  set up to track '…'" on stdout, the script redirected only stderr, and the
  wrapper's `json.loads` fell back to an empty dict — so one line of chatter
  replaced the entire payload, silently, because failing open looks like
  success. `-u` is the shape every first push of a branch uses, which is exactly
  when a caller most wants confirmation: the folklore that "`push_safe`
  returning `{}` means success" was never a design, it was this bug
  ([GH-1099](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1099))
- **Stop four wrappers answering with nothing useful** — `push_safe` emitted
  `"ref": ""` on a detached HEAD; `pre_pr_checks` qualified its argument as
  `origin/$BASE_BRANCH`, so the already-qualified spelling the rest of the
  toolchain passes produced `origin/origin/develop` and failed reading as a git
  problem rather than an argument one; `run_tests` matched its summary against a
  closed outcome vocabulary, so `xpassed` or `deselected` zeroed every count and
  a caller could not tell "ran and passed" from "collected nothing"; and the
  contract row for `check_top_level_comments` omitted its required `pr_number`,
  in the one table written to make first-call inference work
  ([GH-1285](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1285))
- **Give a fresh worktree the rules its own branch holds** — a new worktree kept
  opening with uncommitted deletions in tracked `.claude/rules/*.md` that
  reverted recently-documented content, with about fifteen stashes across many
  worktrees carrying the evidence. `git worktree add` checks those files out at
  the new worktree's own commit, and the post-checkout hook then rsynced the
  source checkout's `.claude/` over the top, excluding only paths dirty in the
  source — so whenever the source sat on an older commit or another branch, its
  copy won. A tracked file belongs to the branch, not to the checkout
  ([GH-1299](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1299))
- **Stop a stale base inflating what a branch changed** — the `{base}-log`,
  `-diff` and `-rebase` aliases computed their merge-base against the *local*
  base ref, so a `develop` last pulled hours ago folded every commit merged since
  into the branch's own diff: one session reviewed 36 changed files where 18 had
  actually changed, and a scope check built on the same aliases agreed with it.
  The `autosquash-{base}` family was already written against origin, so the two
  disagreed about what "since the base" meant. All 15 comparison aliases now
  resolve against `origin/<base>`, and the installer rewrites a superseded
  definition instead of reporting it as already configured
  ([GH-1281](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1281))
- **Let work-on run on a model that has no task tools** — the task tools ship by
  default only on Claude 3.x, Opus 4–4.7, Sonnet 4–4.6 and Haiku 4.5, so "no
  task tools" is a supported configuration and, for anyone on a current model,
  the default one. `work-on`'s Phase 1 self-check was the only place in the repo
  that acknowledged this, and its answer was to stop — which is not a safeguard
  but a refusal to run the plugin's main orchestrator at all. The always-loaded
  rule now separates the mechanism from its purpose: the task list is a
  mechanism, and the purpose — the supervisor sees work in flight, a new prompt
  lands against it, the agent never declares itself done — moves to the
  transcript as a written checklist and a closing `Verify AC` section. It is a
  degradation, not a substitute, and the rule says so
  ([GH-1055](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1055))
- **Stop unread content landing in the working tree** — `command-skill-map.yaml`
  had no entry for `cp`, `mv`, `tee` or `touch`, so a shell copy into the working
  tree never reached `validate-edit-write.py`. The third cost is the one that
  bit: the agent never read what it placed. GH-1245 records an 866-line script
  copied in sight-unseen; re-done as `Read` + `Write` it was immediately found
  wrong — dead `/tmp` paths, a duplicated block, useless timing offsets. A `cp`
  cannot discover correctness, because copying is not reading. DX017 scopes to
  the destination rather than the command, so shell staging under a scratch root
  stays legitimate work
  ([GH-1245](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1245))
- **Stop the secret guard blocking code that names a secret** — `sensitive-files`
  carried `credentials` as a `file_substrings` entry, and substrings match the
  whole path, so every `credentials.py`, `test_credentials.py` and
  `credentials-setup.md` was hard-blocked from Edit and Write with a message
  telling the agent to ask a human — which nobody can answer in an unattended
  run. The guard exists to protect secret *data*, and it was stopping work on the
  code that reads it. A credential store is named `credentials`; a module that
  talks to one is named `credentials.py`, so the distinction lives in the
  extension and exact basenames carry it
  ([GH-1287](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1287))
- **Let the unresolved-thread gate actually run** — the "No unresolved review
  threads" DoD check ran `gh pr view --json reviewThreads`, which is not a valid
  `--json` field, so it failed on every invocation for the feature, bugfix and
  pr-continuation work types and could never return the "0" it expected. A DoD
  check that cannot run is worse than an absent one: it reads as coverage. The
  obvious repair — a raw `gh api graphql` query — is itself hook-blocked and
  steered to the MCP wrapper, which is the only spelling that both runs and is
  permitted ([GH-1290](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1290))
- **Stop a blocked caller being sent back into the block** — six rules in the
  `gh-issue`/`gh-pr` family denied a raw command and then named that same command
  as the fallback. GH-1068 F6 established why that is worse than no hint — it
  reads as sanctioned and costs another round trip to disprove — but the fix
  reached one rule and the rest kept the defect. It turned an MCP outage from an
  inconvenience into a hard stop, with reads the acute loss since a read has no
  guardrail to bypass. The five mutating rules gain an `except` escape that the
  fallback names, scoped separately from reads, and a family-wide guard stops the
  class returning
  ([GH-1266](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1266))
- **Stop the catalog promising a route it never seeded** —
  `git-dir-worktree-pinning` steers agents to `git -C <path> <verb>` and says
  that is "what allow rules are written against", but no `git -C` rule had ever
  been seeded while the plumbing shape it deprecates carried 18: the recommended
  remedy prompted and the deprecated one did not, and `permission_catalog_gap`
  could not see it, because a rule that was never catalogued cannot be reported
  missing. Nine read-only verb-scoped rules are seeded — not the verb-blind
  `Bash(git -C:*)`, which would also grant `git -C <path> push --force` — and two
  comments asserting the rest are corrected
  ([GH-1268](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1268),
  [GH-1260](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1260))
- **Tell the engineer the bot identity is dark, not absent** — the GitHub App sat
  configured and silently unused for months, with four defects stacked so each
  aborted before the next became reachable while `github-app status` reported
  healthy throughout: the `~/.claude/Dev10x` → `~/.config/Dev10x` migration
  rewrote neither the `private_key_path` inside the yaml nor the seven paths in
  the setup doc; the documented permission set omitted `issues:write`, which
  comment posting needs; the acceptance step an edited App raises was documented
  nowhere; and status checked only that config existed. Separately, `merged_by`
  named the same engineer for the orchestrator, every crew worker and the human,
  so a merge that bypassed the pre-merge gate could not be attributed even in
  principle — `merge_pr(use_bot=…)` now reports `merged_as` and falls back out
  loud ([GH-1271](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1271),
  [GH-1272](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1272))
- **Prevent gate diagnostics from hiding the real posture** — a gate resolution
  named only its preset, so a value supplied by an overlay, a project override or
  a session override was indistinguishable from a baseline one: a repo carrying
  two overlays reported a bare `preset:adaptive`, which is how GH-1252 came to be
  filed as "gate_overlays is inert" against a resolver that applies them
  correctly. Three further predicate divergences shared the shape — the
  SessionStart banner gated on a plugin-version string it could not relate to
  config state, `session.yaml` sat outside every store the migrator walks while
  its residual keys tripped a refusal naming that migrator, and
  `_needs_migration` never inspected `active_modes`. Gate resolution semantics
  are unchanged; only diagnostics and the migrator's reach move
  ([GH-1252](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1252))
- **Surface a retired config file before it takes effect** — ADR-0018 D2 retired
  the per-repo `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml`, and nothing was made responsible
  for removing what was already there; the migrator deliberately will not, since
  folding a stale file over live config would overwrite the posture in force. It
  is inert only while a `projects[]` entry shadows it — rename the directory,
  drop the entry, or open a worktree the globs miss, and it becomes the tier-2
  read, at which point its residual v1 keys stop gate resolution. The instance in
  this repo asserted the inverse posture of the one in force, so the trap was a
  contradiction, not just a refusal, and a supervisor cannot see it by reading
  either file alone
  ([GH-1259](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1259))
- **Stop a truncated contract reading as a complete one** — three SKILL.md files
  tell the agent to read their `instructions.md` "end-to-end", and for `work-on`,
  `fanout` and `skill-audit` that cannot be done in one call: the file is larger
  than a single `Read` returns, so an agent that stops there holds part of the
  contract while believing it holds all of it. Measured on `work-on`: 57% unread,
  with the Plan Completion Gate, the pre-gate checklist and the merge-gated
  completion rule all in the unread tail. The existing enforcement block was
  attached to the two skills whose files fit, where the failure cannot happen,
  and missing from the three where it is structural
  ([GH-1279](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1279))
- **Keep release notes collectable from any PR body** — the two patterns that
  read a Job Story out of a merged PR body backtrack over the whole body, so
  their cost came from the number of failing `**When**` positions rather than
  from the story: 107ms at 4.6KB, 844ms at 9.2KB, 6.8s at 18.4KB. GitHub accepts
  65536 characters and on a repo taking outside contributions those bodies are
  written by strangers, so a single crafted PR could hold the release job for
  minutes. Bounding the patterns' own groups was the tempting fix and the wrong
  one — a clause containing bold text would stop matching, turning a loud stall
  into a story quietly missing from release notes, which is the trade GH-1291
  just closed. Windowing changes no pattern
  ([GH-1293](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1293))
- **Accept a Job Story in the project's own language** — the skill tells writers
  to use the project's language, but `create_pr` matched the English markers as
  literals, so a Polish story written exactly as its own project prescribed was
  refused at the only point that could still accept it, and the workaround it
  forced — English markers wrapped around Polish prose — reads worse than either
  language alone. The markers were English for a real reason: the release-notes
  extractor located a story by matching `**When**`, so accepting Polish in the
  validator alone would have traded a loud rejection for a silent hole. Both
  surfaces move together, Polish verb inflections are covered rather than one
  form pinned, and a story mixing two languages is refused — that hybrid is the
  old workaround, not a target
  ([GH-1291](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1291))
- **Stop a fork PR reporting two checks that cannot pass** — GitHub refuses OIDC
  minting for a `pull_request` run whose head is a fork, so `claude-review` and
  `hygiene-review` fail at token minting, and the error compounds it by asking
  whether `id-token: write` was added when both workflows declare exactly that
  one line below the failure. Both checks are non-required, so nothing was
  blocking a merge — the cost was silent instead: two permanently-red columns
  teach reviewers to read a red CI as "just the fork thing", which is the state
  in which a genuine failure goes unnoticed. Skipping is the honest report, and
  no coverage is lost because none was ever produced
  ([GH-1226](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1226))

### Docs

- **Settle which checks a merge to develop must clear** — `develop` carries no
  branch-protection rule at all (the API answers 404), so every CI leg reports
  advisory-only and the nine pre-merge validations in `Dev10x:gh-pr-merge` gate
  nothing, while an armed auto-merge lands the instant CI settles. The finding
  was observed across four PRs in one session and re-raised in three consecutive
  bundles without being actioned, because nothing durable recorded an answer.
  ADR-0024 requires `test` and `floors` and says why each other leg is
  deliberately excluded — `git-history-linting` is red by design while fixups
  exist, `hygiene-review` never re-runs on a push, `claude-review` goes red on an
  org-wide API cap. Status stays Proposed: writing the rule is a privileged
  repository setting, left to the supervisor
  ([GH-1283](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1283))

## 0.98.0 — Titles a Reader Can Tell Apart & Captures That Cannot Lie

Released 2026-09-08

### Features

- **Make a release list readable by the person who pays for it** — a 17-PR
  release shipped with eleven titles opening `Let <actor> <verb>`, sibling PRs
  separated only by a verb, and four naming a system — "the CRM", "the schema
  poller" — as the actor. The cause was structural, not stylistic: `git-commit`
  Step 2.5 derived every title by transposing the Job Story's fixed-shape "so X
  can" clause, so exactly one frame was reachable, and the verb denylist waved
  `Let` and `Keep` through twelve times. Step 2.5 now derives the title from
  memo 006's ROI bucket and the shape of the truth, offers two frames, and runs
  eight checks (human-first actor, sibling distinctness, "and" split, second
  meaning, incumbent paraphrase, `Hold <contract>` for generated-only work, the
  release-list bullseye); `Dev10x:jtbd` gains a sixth Platform-integrity
  bucket, ranks diff/PR/QA/human quotes above agent-written ticket prose, and
  reads ticket comments rather than descriptions alone. The rules were derived
  from re-writing all 17 titles and having each approved individually — five of
  those approvals reframed the job the agent had named
  ([GH-1225](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1225))
- **Spare a maintainer findings they are already tracking** — filing from
  `Dev10x:skill-audit` was mandatory and ungated, and no step asked whether a
  finding was already filed, so an audit run late in a session whose earlier
  findings had reached the tracker by another route re-filed all of them; in the
  run that surfaced this, three of three were already tracked and a fourth
  asserted a skill documented an attribute as a method when the shipped file
  said otherwise. Filing now searches the tracker open and closed first,
  suppresses an already-open finding with its issue number, re-files a closed
  one only when the behaviour recurred after it, and requires any claim about a
  shipped file to quote that file read at filing time — withdrawing the finding
  when it contradicts
  ([GH-1244](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1244))

### Fixes

- **Stop a narrated walkthrough passing as clean when it lost a beat** — a
  `qa-self` capture could drop a whole narrated line, film past a step that
  failed, and still report `unrendered: []`, because that list was derived from
  the lines that *played*: a declared line whose `say()` never ran was absent by
  construction. Declared and played lines are now tracked separately and
  `never_played` fails `verify-evidence` and blocks publishing; a caption must
  hold the state it asserts before it cues, and unasserted beats are reported;
  a blank declared line is refused at construction — quoting its index and text
  — before fixtures are set up or a browser opens; the `collapse_line` clip-key
  contract is split out and pinned on both sides of the synthesis subprocess
  boundary, where silent drift produced video with captions and no voice at all;
  `require()` raises on an absent or ambiguous locator, and a scanner catches
  the bare `if locator.count():` guard shape it was written for. The deploy
  check now detects the deploy model and reports "check not performed" naming
  the unset knob, distinct from "not deployed"; synthesis is gated on a fixture
  probe so a failed fixture costs fixture time and no model load; and clips are
  reused across takes from a content-addressed cache keyed on voice, language
  and the TTS pin

  [GH-1240](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1240))
- **Let a language pin reach the voice that actually narrates** — PR #1228
  closed this issue with a `Fixes:` trailer and carried no commit for it, so
  only half the fix landed: `--lang` forwarding shipped incidentally, the
  default did not. Both documented call sites pass neither lang nor voice, so
  the wrapper resolved the language-agnostic `voice:` key and skipped the
  `languages:` pin on the one path whose output reaches a client — while `tts
  check --lang en` read the pin and cheerfully reported the commercial voice.
  Language now resolves as explicit argument, then `DEV10X_TTS_LANG`, then
  `DEFAULT_LANG`; a language-blind legacy runner is refused only when a language
  was actually asked for, and reports `None` rather than claiming one was
  applied; `commercial_use_allowed` is carried into the manifest as disclosure.
  Licence compliance stays the supervisor's call — this surfaces terms and adds
  no publish refusal
  ([GH-1221](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1221))
- **Stop a PR closing an issue it never delivered** — `gh-pr-merge` Check 1d
  compared linked-issue scope against the diff by reasoning, the right
  instrument for the hard case and the wrong one for the easy one. The easy case
  is what shipped wrong: PR #1228 declared six `Fixes:` links, carried commits
  for five, and closed GH-1221 with nothing behind it. A wrongly-closed issue
  reads as settled and drops out of every future sweep. The body's closing links
  are now diffed deterministically against the ticket IDs in the commits — whole
  messages, so a batched commit backs every member it lists — and the merge is
  blocked on any unbacked link unless `--acknowledge` records a human decision
  ([GH-1241](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1241))
- **Make plugin-doctor findings worth reading** — two strategies buried their
  real hits in noise. `ask-shadows-allow` reported every broad-allow/narrow-deny
  pairing as drift — 69 of 73 findings in the 2026-09-07 audit, each advising
  the reader to dismantle a guardrail (`git push` with `--force` denied, `docker
  run` with `--privileged` denied) — so the four real collisions were
  unfindable. An exact cross-bucket duplicate is now drift; a strict narrowing
  is a suggestion that says plainly the pairing is usually intentional.
  `mcp-vs-script-drift` compared byte offsets across the whole SKILL.md, so an
  `allowed-tools:` block listing a script path beside its MCP equivalent read as
  "script documented first" — an unordered declaration with no prose to reorder.
  Frontmatter is stripped before the ordering scan and findings deduplicate by
  source-relative path, clearing 25 of 26
  ([GH-1222](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1222),
  [GH-1223](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1223))
- **Ensure a push report names the branch that moved** — four consecutive
  pushes after an `EnterWorktree` reported a ref and sha that did not match the
  remote. The pushes landed: worktrees share an object store and a ref
  namespace, so `git push origin <branch>` succeeds from any of them, while
  `rev-parse HEAD` answers for whichever checkout the long-lived MCP daemon is
  standing in. Callers that branch on `ref`/`sha` — `gh-pr-respond`,
  `gh-pr-monitor` — were reading a value about the wrong branch. The sha is now
  resolved from the source half of the refspec, tracking from that same ref, and
  a delete refspec reports no sha at all
  ([GH-1220](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1220))

### Docs

- **Let a walkthrough be argued from a written decision** — the walkthrough
  capability grew inside `qa-self` incrementally and is now shared, in different
  shapes, by QA evidence, demo video and the tt-e2e suite, with nothing
  recording the decisions governing it. An ADR records the three-skill
  decomposition, decides per-scenario capture over one continuous take as
  failure containment first (six consecutive takes died in setup; a thirteen-take
  run lost every earlier chapter's cue offsets to one late crash), states the
  clip contract as offsets rebased from measured durations, ties annotation
  richness to who can repair a break — which is why tt-e2e stays standalone —
  and says plainly what `verify-evidence.py` does not check
  ([GH-1242](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1242))
- **Enable a narrated capture to verify and re-run** — Phase 4.1 told the reader
  to run the verifier on the raw `.webm` before converting, but the voice-over
  is muxed on in 4.3, so a narrated take could never satisfy the audio checks
  the phase demanded and a session following it read a guaranteed failure as its
  own mistake. The phase is split (structural checks on the `.webm`, audio
  checks on the muxed `-narrated.mp4`), the hardcoded accounts are replaced with
  read-the-account-map guidance, and probing gets a name, a workflow slot and
  its own `self-qa/probes/` namespace so probe residue stops landing beside
  formal evidence
  ([GH-1229](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1229),
  [GH-1230](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1230),
  [GH-1233](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1233))
- **Let qa-scope and the e2e reviewer fire on the suite in front of them** —
  `Dev10x:qa-scope` shipped with one deployment's filesystem baked in, and its
  coverage check failed in the worst direction: a suite that was never searched
  returns exactly what a suite with no matching scenarios returns, so the
  verdict recommended writing tests that may already exist. Phase 3.0 resolves
  `$E2E_ROOT` from project config, a sibling `*-e2e` checkout, or a `features/`
  dir, and reports "not performed" when none does. The `reviewer-e2e` spec was
  written against pytest-bdd while the suite it reviews runs behave, so its
  triggers matched nothing in a behave layout and its checklist demanded a
  `scenarios()` call that correctly does not exist — triggers widened, a
  framework-difference table added, duplicate steps raised to CRITICAL (behave
  aborts the run where pytest-bdd silently takes the last), and the
  `context.execute_steps()` DocString trap documented
  ([GH-1231](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1231))
- **Keep one deployment's accounts out of a shipped skill** — GH-1230 took one
  deployment's test accounts out of `qa-self`, and the same class survived in
  two sibling skills of the same pipeline: a plugin user reading
  `skills/playwright/SKILL.md` was told to authenticate as accounts that do not
  exist for them, and the `qa-publish` PR-comment template named one staging
  shop as though it were every reader's. This defect only breaks for other
  people — the runtime path reads the account map from config and works fine for
  the deployment the names came from — which makes it unlikely to be reported by
  anyone able to fix it. Permission levels replace usernames, the dealer number
  becomes a backticked placeholder (angle brackets vanish when GitHub strips an
  unknown tag), and all three are pinned by test
  ([GH-1235](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1235))

## 0.97.0 — One Review Question, Every Rule Tier & Loops That Get Denied

Released 2026-09-05

### Features

- **Let one durable fact answer whether the supervisor reads the PR** —
  `strict` / `guided` / `adaptive` survived as artefacts of the pre-ADR-0016
  ladder rather than because anyone chose between them, and ADR-0019's
  `human_review` boolean conflated two different readers, which is why it could
  only ever gate `merge`. ADR-0022 collapses the shipped presets to `adaptive`
  alone and replaces the boolean with a per-project `supervisor_review:
  required | none`, whose effect point moves with repo shape — before `merge`
  in a solo repo, before `request_review` in a team one. It is expressed as a
  floor, never a toggle, so `required` stays a precondition and `none` a
  precondition-for-autonomy rather than a grant of it; GH-1008's existing
  `review:cleared` label is what lifts the park, so no second sign-off channel
  was invented. A config still speaking v1 is refused naming `dev10x config
  migrate-schema` — resolving it silently would hand auto-merge to exactly the
  repo that had asked for less — and the migrator fails every ambiguous input
  toward `required`. `pin_supervisor_review` persists the answer, and both
  `Dev10x:onboarding` and `Dev10x:friction-setup` now ask the one question
  instead of a retired three-way picker

- **Let the permission catalog express and deliver every rule tier** — there
  was no `base_asks` key, so an ask-tier rule had nowhere to live even though
  DX014 argues a sensitive-but-legitimate operation should prompt rather than
  hard-deny; allow seeding ignored each file's own deny list and re-added a
  contradiction on every upgrade; and the git-tracked-settings guard had
  exactly one caller, so four sibling writers dirtied a tracked `settings.json`
  the SKIP line implied was protected. All three tiers now reach project files,
  the guard is derived from the source AST so an unlisted new writer fails
  loudly instead of being skipped, and `WRITE_TOOLS_NOT_SEEDED` lives in
  `enumerate_mcp` so the runtime report and CI cannot disagree
  ([GH-1149](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1149),

- **Let friction diagnosis stop being a source of friction** — the first
  diagnostic step of the skill whose whole job is diagnosing permission
  friction hardcoded a raw `uvx dev10x permission catalog-gap`; unattended, a
  pending prompt is neither a block nor a denial, so the coverage check
  silently never ran and Step 3a's three-outcome routing was unreachable. A
  `permission_catalog_gap` MCP tool over the same domain function is
  catalogued in the same commit that registers it, and the catalog gains
  `uv add` / `uv remove` plus the scratch-root `cp`/`mv` forms a night crew
  actually types

  [GH-1197](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1197))
- **Let a published walkthrough be corrected, withdrawn, or caveated** —
  `Dev10x:yt-upload` could create videos but not update or delete them, so one
  session's four takes left three orphaned uploads still resolving for anyone
  holding the link, and a caveat found after upload never reached the YouTube
  description. Update merges onto the stored snippet (`videos.update` replaces
  rather than merges), delete demands both an `AskUserQuestion` gate and
  `--yes`, and the wider `youtube.force-ssl` scope is demanded per operation
  so publishing keeps the narrow grant. A QA fixture's flags are incidental,
  so the PR comment must now lead with a fixture-vs-production caveat and is
  edited in place per PR rather than re-posted

  [GH-1213](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1213))
- **Let a Chat notification reach the thread it answers** — `Dev10x:gchat`
  could only post top-level messages, so a reply started its own thread and
  landed detached from the conversation it answered, and stale review cards
  pointing at superseded links could not be fixed. Both were listed as
  platform limits; neither is one
  ([GH-1203](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1203),
  [GH-1207](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1207))
- **Enable narration in Polish and licence-free English** — most good English
  Piper voices are CC BY-NC-SA, so the licence gate had to be negotiated per
  voice; Kokoro's weights are Apache-2.0 but it has no Polish at all (its
  `pf_`/`pm_` voices read as Polish and are Brazilian Portuguese). Routing by
  language — Kokoro for English, Piper for Polish — leaves both defaults with
  a quiet gate, and the engine is inferred from the voice-name shape so the
  runner contract callers depend on does not change
  ([GH-1200](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1200))
- **Let one place answer every gog setup question** — three of the four traps
  that decide whether a first-time gog OAuth setup succeeds are not
  YouTube-specific at all, so documenting them inside `Dev10x:yt-upload` put
  shared knowledge behind a skill most callers never open. `Dev10x:gog` carries
  the contract with a chapter router, symptom-first
  ([GH-1156](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1156))

### Fixes

- **Let a Monitor poll loop be denied, not prompted** — every command submitted
  through the `Monitor` tool bypassed the whole PreToolUse validator chain.
  `hooks.json` had registered the matcher since GH-1138, but
  `_validate_bash_body` exited on `tool_name != "Bash"` before a single
  validator ran, so DX001–DX016 never saw a Monitor command and the
  registration shipped inert — a hand-rolled `while true … sleep` loop reached
  the supervisor as a raw permission prompt no allow rule can answer, and
  unattended it wedged the turn. Two narrower gaps kept the loop rules blind
  even on the Bash path (single-line patterns, and a fast-path token filter
  that dropped the command before the rule engine saw it); loops are matched on
  shape now, not on the command inside
  ([GH-1211](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1211),
  [GH-1212](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1212))
- **Let the catalog guard see every registered tool** — the GH-1153 guard
  passed 3/3 on `develop` while blind to roughly four fifths of the registered
  MCP surface: discovery scanned a hard-coded five-module list against twelve
  tool modules, so all of `gate_tools.py` — `resolve_gate` included, called by
  every skill gate since GH-1168 — was never looked at, and it matched only
  `@server.tool()`, missing the `@github_tool` wrapper that registers 48 of ~50
  GitHub handlers. A tool absent from `base_permissions` can never be seeded by
  `ensure-base`, so each one prompted once per checkout, forever, while looking
  fully wired up everywhere a reader would think to check. Discovery now globs
  the tool modules, 36 newly visible tools are catalogued, and a test counts
  registration decorators in the tree so a narrowed scan fails loudly
  ([GH-1215](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1215))
- **Let a crew worker survive its own shell commands** — ten of ten crew
  recoveries in a 27-hour foreman run were a permission prompt opened by a
  shell shape, never a code problem. A prompt records neither a block nor a
  denial, so each frozen worker cost ~15 minutes of watchdog attention plus a
  respawned generation, and one chunk needed seven. Every shape already had a
  ban somewhere in the brief — but a ban on line 160 does not fire when the
  worker reaches for the command at line 12 of its own reasoning, so every
  brief now opens with a FATAL SHAPES block. Underneath it, the Dev10x MCP
  tools were absent for the foreman and every worker from the first dispatch
  while the watchdog kept them, and pre-flight passed 12 of 12 because it
  probes at depth 1; the probe now runs at crew depth
  ([GH-1214](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1214))
- **Let a merged bundle actually close its constituents** — `close-issues.yml`
  passed on PR #1193 while closing none of its eight linked issues: the
  extractor required a full GitHub URL and the body used the bare `Fixes: GH-N`
  form this repo's own convention prescribes, so zero matches reported as
  success. Since this repo merges to `develop`, GitHub's native auto-close never
  fires and that job is the only mechanism there is. Bare refs are recognised,
  zero closable references now fails, and per-issue prior state is read rather
  than assumed
  ([GH-1196](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1196))
- **Let the sanctioned test wrapper run a suite that needs an extra** — two
  independent sessions failed the skill-routing DoD check on the same day for
  the same reason: `run_tests` hardcoded a bare `uv run pytest`, which dies at
  collection here with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'factory'`, so the
  agent fell back to raw pytest and the fallback then persisted for every
  iteration of the fix-test loop. The wrapper now resolves the extras group
  that declares pytest
  ([GH-1198](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1198))
- **Let a CI status failure say what went wrong** — `ci_check_status` returned
  `{"error": ""}` for every PR across two repos. `gh pr checks` signals its
  verdict through the exit code while still writing the requested JSON, so any
  PR whose checks were not all green aborted; the failure then reported through
  stdout while the wrapper read only stderr. An empty error string reads as
  success to a caller branching on truthiness
  ([GH-1192](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1192))
- **Let a reviewer request reach GitHub as an array** — list fields were
  serialised as repeated `-f 'key[]=value'` flags, which older `gh` sends as a
  literal field named `key[]`, so GitHub rejected every `request_review` with
  `"reviewers" wasn't supplied` — naming the very field that was passed, and
  pushing users onto the raw `gh api` POST the review gate exists to keep them
  off ([GH-1191](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1191))
- **Let the catalog be found from an installed wheel** — four modules located
  the shipped catalog with a fixed `parents[4]` hop that only lands on the repo
  root from a checkout. From site-packages the path named a file that cannot
  exist, nothing raised, and `doctor` silently resumed flagging rules
  `ensure-base` had just written: "could not check" read as "nothing is wrong"
  ([GH-1190](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1190),
  [GH-1151](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1151))
- **Let an escaped-paren rule survive generalization** — every generalize
  pattern ended in `[^)]+`, which stops at the first `)` including an escaped
  one, so a rule holding a SQL predicate closed early and emitted a malformed
  allow rule. Claude Code discards an invalid rule without comment on the next
  read, so a working rule was destroyed while the run reported success; every
  generated rule is now validated before writing, and each refusal named
  ([GH-1150](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1150))
- **Let a QA recording fill the frame it records and keep its Full HD raster**
  — Playwright's `record_video_size` only ever scales down, so every recipe
  pairing a 1680×1050 viewport with a 1920×1080 recording sat 1:1 in the
  top-left with mid-grey padding on two edges, and the snippets a real script
  copies recorded below the canonical raster with no `device_scale_factor`. A
  padded file has real dimensions, real size and non-uniform frames, so nothing
  caught it; `verify-evidence.py` gains a border check and Phase 4.4 reports
  raster off the file rather than off the script meant to produce it
  ([GH-1204](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1204),
  [GH-1188](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1188))
- **Let a narrated take anchor to the footage it narrates** — the recipe opened
  the recorded context and only then pre-rendered the whole script, so
  synthesis was recorded as a static screen and every cue shifted behind it: a
  measured run lost ~36s of dead head frames and ran the voice-over ~16s past
  the end. Neither failure was visible to the verifier, which samples frames
  rather than the published container
  ([GH-1205](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1205))
- **Let a first-time yt-upload setup follow a path that works** — the
  prerequisites told operators to append `youtube.upload` to their existing gog
  service list, but Google refuses Drive and YouTube scopes in one consent, so
  that command cannot succeed on any account holding the Drive grant — which is
  every account the other Dev10x Google skills set up
  ([GH-1156](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1156))

### Refactoring

- **Let `friction_level` mean one thing again** — the key in
  `command-skill-map.yaml` was the ADR-0002 command-redirect axis, a different
  dial that happened to share a name with the gate preset. Only `guided` was
  ever shipped, and whether a rule blocks at all is already per-rule
  `hook_block`, so the tiers were untested configuration surface
  ([GH-1194](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1194))
- **Let a playbook step state its behaviour once** — with one baseline, a
  step's `friction.adaptive:` branch was the only branch that ever applied.
  Every adaptive prompt is inlined into the step it modified, and the key is
  gone from the schema, the resolution order and `playbook diff`
  ([GH-1171](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1171))
- **Let every gate decision ask the resolver** — `work-on`, `fanout`,
  `skill-audit`, `git-groom`, `gh-pr-create`, `gh-review-setup`, `review`,
  `git-commit` and `verify-acc-dod` each re-derived posture from a session-file
  value in prose. They now resolve the gate they mean, so nesting cannot
  re-impose a gate the resolver auto-advanced
  ([GH-1168](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1168),
  [GH-1172](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1172))

### Docs & Guidance

- **Let the policy docs describe the seam that exists** — the schema reference
  still led with `friction_level` as a required enum and `human_review` as a
  boolean, so an operator hand-authoring `friction.yaml` from that page would
  produce a v1 file the migrator then had to convert; `walk-away.md` was half a
  trail of what a retired key used to mean; and 24 skills carried an
  auto-advance line naming a condition that no longer distinguishes anything
  ([GH-1169](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1169),
  [GH-1185](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1185),
  [GH-1186](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1186),
  [GH-1187](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1187),
  [GH-1194](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1194))
- **Let an upgrade prove the catalog reached every file** — confirming an
  upgrade landed meant reading the maintenance log, which is exactly what let
  GH-1136 hide for months: `ensure-base` reported "all base permissions already
  covered" while 137 of 285 rules were absent from every project file. The log
  was truthful and the outcome was wrong, so the new four-step checklist runs
  against the files
  ([GH-1137](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1137))
- **Let a fanout worker know when holding work is wrong** — a skill-audit of a
  3-item run found the anti-stall rule stated as an activity list, so a worker
  holding five uncommitted files "waiting for the test suite" believed it was
  compliant; the sibling bus is demoted to best-effort since appending is
  hook-blocked and a whole-file Write silently clobbers the first poster
  ([GH-1173](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1173))

## 0.96.0 — Catalog Propagation, Narrated Evidence & Outside-Session Recovery

Released 2026-09-02

### Features

- **Wake a quota-paused night run from outside every session** — a platform
  pause takes the session and its event queue down together, so a run cannot
  observe its own quota reset: `foreman watch` emitted QUOTA RESET 15 minutes
  after the 2026-08-31 freeze and nothing delivered it, leaving five hours of
  paid capacity unused until the supervisor returned. `dev10x watchdog` now
  runs from cron or a systemd timer and owns the three parts that are ours —
  reading the 5h block offline, finding runs whose heartbeats have all gone
  silent, and firing at most once per block boundary. It deliberately does not
  speak the harness cross-session protocol; the operator supplies the resume
  command their setup supports
  ([GH-1109](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1109))
- **Let a filed ticket arrive already triaged** — the filing tools always
  accepted `milestone` and `labels`, but no flow populated them, so the backlog
  depended on manual restructure sweeps: on 2026-08-30, 11 of 16 open issues
  were unmilestoned and 10 of 13 unlabeled, every one filed through these
  wrappers. A read-only `triage_roster` exposes open milestones and the live
  label roster in one call, `Dev10x:ticket-create` proposes both from it, and
  `needs-triage` is filed when nothing fits so strays stay findable
  ([GH-1102](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1102))
- **Let a walkthrough recording speak and frame its own story** — `qa-self`
  captions were already narration copy, but nothing spoke them and nothing
  persisted them, so a reviewer read a caption bar that had often already timed
  out. `Dev10x:tts` wraps piper (one batched process, licence reported never
  enforced), caption dwell derives from the spoken audio so the two cannot
  drift, and nine annotation shapes returned by five real capture runs —
  redaction that survives navigation, before/after compare, steps and measured
  chapters, absence captions, interstitial cards, highlight/zoom/hold — compose
  with the pointer halo rather than replacing it
  ([GH-1112](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1112),
  [GH-1126](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1126))
- **Let QA evidence reach a shareable link and assemble without a prompt** —
  `qa-self`'s publish step only knew Linear, so a walkthrough that would carry
  the argument on a PR had nowhere to go. `Dev10x:yt-upload` and
  `Dev10x:qa-publish` return the embed form each destination can use, resolve
  account and channel from userspace config with no built-in default, and
  namespace the borrowed token per uid and pid. Stitching an evidence sheet no
  longer prompts either — the composing verbs ship as a catalog group in both
  the IM6 and IM7 spellings
  ([GH-1119](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1119),
  [GH-1141](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1141))
- **Let the PR surface carry the caller's body, branch and milestone** —
  `create_pr` assembled every body from `job_story` plus a generated commit
  list, so anything else the caller supplied was dropped silently; it derived
  the head branch from the invoking process's CWD, leaving a cross-worktree
  orchestrator no way to name the branch it meant; and nothing on the MCP
  surface could write a milestone, so `gh-pr-monitor` Phase 3.5 always took its
  silent skip branch on a bundle PR
  ([GH-1073](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1073),
  [GH-1098](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1098))
- **Let a waiter sit out bot legs while a required check is red** — a Phase 4.6
  dispatcher needed the review legs to anchor before grooming force-pushed
  their SHAs, but on any branch carrying `fixup!` commits the required
  `git-history-linting` leg fails by design, and `wait_out_pending` covers a
  failed ADVISORY leg only. The dispatcher read the contract correctly,
  hand-rolled a `while`/`sleep` loop through `Monitor` — which no hook
  validated — and stalled on a prompt. `wait_for` names checks that must settle
  regardless, `Monitor` joins the same validator chain as `Bash`, and both
  hand-rolled loop shapes are now hard blocks
  ([GH-1138](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1138))
- **Let diag-friction see a missing permission layer** — the skill a supervisor
  reaches for at the moment of friction audited rule shapes but never asked
  whether the effective settings file carried the catalog at all, so a worktree
  short by 137 of 285 rules stayed "constantly stuck on basic actions" while
  every run diagnosed the individual command. A new Step 3a resolves the file
  the engine actually reads, runs `catalog-gap`, and gates any backfill behind
  a required question
  ([GH-1139](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1139))
- **Let a blocked command name the rule that stopped it** — audit records for a
  denied command carried only `outcome=block` and a timing, so a day's log
  could say seventeen blocks happened but never which rules fired, making
  friction impossible to prioritise by frequency or to prove fixed. `rule_id`
  now rides from the emitting validator through to the audit record
  ([GH-1095](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1095))
- **Let open loops outlive the exchange that raised them** — `Dev10x:ask` saw
  only decision-shaped questions in the last 10-15 turns; a promised follow-up,
  a finding scrolled past, an unanswered supervisor question had no detector
  and left no trace. Mode 3 detects four loop shapes with closed-by criteria,
  reconciles against the task list, and routes only decisions into the widget
  batch ([GH-1081](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1081))
- **Enable formatted Google Chat review panels by default** — notifications
  could only carry one plain-text body, so a review request arrived as an
  undifferentiated run of text. `cardsV2` panels ship with a
  markup-to-card-HTML translator, mentions kept in the text half where they
  still notify, and default-on with both per-repo and global opt-outs intact
  ([GH-1113](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1113),
  [GH-1115](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1115))
- **Let a batched shell loop and a plumbing git read steer instead of prompt** —
  a `for`/`xargs` loop over a known list collapses N individually-approved
  calls into one unmatchable command, and `git --git-dir=… status` from a
  worktree matched none of the pre-approved prefixes while offering `git *` as
  the "don't ask again" rule. The loop shape now carries an advisory steer to
  parallel Bash calls; the plumbing spelling is pre-approved for read-only
  verbs in both argument orderings, with mutating verbs still routed to the git
  skills ([GH-1117](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1117),
  [GH-1135](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1135))
- **Let the capture path serve any deployment or checkout layout** — two
  hardcoded values made `run-playwright.sh` unusable as documented outside one
  deployment and one pair of accounts, so users forked it and lost the
  syntax-validation and no-hardcoded-credentials guarantees it exists to
  provide. `STAGING_URL` gets the `${VAR:-default}` treatment, and a credential
  map read from the secrets file makes a third account two lines of config.
  `qa-self` Phase 1.2 had the same defect one layer up — absolute clone paths
  and the argocd manifest path were baked into the deploy check, so the one
  step the skill calls critical could not run outside a single layout and was
  the first to get skipped, with a teammate falling back to a local script.
  Every remaining deployment path is now the fallback half of a documented
  override, pinned so it cannot drift back
  ([GH-1130](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1130),
  [GH-1147](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1147))

### Fixes

- **Let the catalog reach every project settings file** — once a machine's
  global `~/.claude/settings.json` had been seeded, no catalog rule ever
  reached a project file again: both write paths filtered the rendered catalog
  against global before writing, and `include_user_settings` puts global in the
  same list. Every addition after that first seeding was a no-op for every
  project — 137 of 285 shipped rules absent — while the run printed "All base
  permissions already covered by global settings." Writes are now unfiltered
  (`--dedupe-global` restores the old behaviour as opt-in), per-file counts are
  reported, a real write that leaves a gap exits non-zero, and `catalog-gap`
  makes verification a command rather than an inference
  ([GH-1136](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1136))
- **Let an edit keep the code it did not touch** — the PostToolUse formatter ran
  `ruff format` plus `ruff check --fix` over the whole file after every edit.
  Each Edit+hook pair is evaluated in isolation, so a three-edit revert had an
  intermediate state where an import genuinely was unused: F401 stripped it,
  edit 3 restored the call site, nothing restored the import, and the file was
  left raising `NameError` at a line nobody edited. No individual step was
  wrong. Formatting is now scoped to the edited hunk, lint fixes are gone
  entirely, the project's own line-length configuration is honoured, and the
  notice names the changed lines instead of saying "likely a formatter"
  ([GH-1143](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1143))
- **Stop a groom from fusing a fix into a foreign commit** — when a branch's PR
  is merged by rebase the base gains the same patch under a different SHA, so
  `git rebase -i <base>` drops the todo's `pick` as already-applied and replays
  the trailing `fixup` onto whatever sits at the base tip, fusing a 267-line
  fix into an unrelated commit and losing the feature commit. The tool reported
  `conflict: true` with an empty file list while git saw no conflict, and
  following its hint completed the damage. The groom now refuses on an obsolete
  branch, disables rerere, and reports a stop with no unmerged paths as
  `REBASE_PAUSED` ([GH-1103](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1103))
- **Let an unknown tool parameter name itself** — FastMCP's generated arg model
  neither forbids extra keys nor carries them into the handler, so a parameter
  a release does not have is dropped twice over and the tool returns success
  having changed nothing: `update_pr(milestone=55)` against a pre-GH-1098
  install reported success and left the field null. Every wrapper gains that
  hazard the moment its documented surface runs ahead of the released one, so
  unknown arguments are now rejected at the boundary, naming each one and the
  running plugin version
  ([GH-1122](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1122))
- **Let a search name a linter without being blocked** — the DX016 guard split
  commands on `|` with a raw string split that ignores shell quoting, so
  `rg -n "pre-commit|ruff|mypy" settings.json` cut into three fragments whose
  middle was the bare token `ruff` — denied, with a suggested remedy that
  cannot apply to a search. Segmentation is now quote-aware and also covers
  `&&`, `;` and `||`
  ([GH-1133](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1133))
- **Let a bundle PR close every issue it names** — a bundle PR passing two issue
  references got one `Fixes` line, so only the first auto-closed and the second
  stayed open with nothing saying why. From the same 14-lane run: a swarm child
  that lost the MCP server fell back to raw `gh` for the merge itself, bypassing
  every pre-merge validation, because the template mandated wrappers but never
  said what to do when they are unreachable
  ([GH-1107](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1107))
- **Let a crew worker bound its own CI wait** — the crew template told workers to
  wait with an unbounded `ci_check_status(wait=true)` and named no fallback: on
  one night run CI recorded SUCCESS at 20:35Z and the worker was still "waiting
  on CI" when it was killed at 21:25Z. The wait is now pinned and falls back to
  the check rollup; separately `poll_until_terminal` probes before sleeping, so
  a call landing after CI finished no longer pays 60s for a verdict GitHub had
  already decided ([GH-1088](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1088))
- **Let fanout tear down locked agent worktrees** — an Agent-tool worktree can
  still hold the harness lock when teardown starts, so every
  `git worktree remove` failed with "cannot remove a locked working tree" and
  five of nine teardowns in one evening stalled — while the error text steers
  the reader to `remove -f -f`, which bypasses the dirty-tree checks that keep
  unmerged work ([GH-1094](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1094))
- **Let a body-only review round retire the earlier round** — "only the latest
  round is authoritative" was keyed on review summary comments alone, so a
  reviewer whose final round was a body checklist refresh plus an empty-body
  review left the previous round's INFO findings demanding a disposition after
  they had effectively signed off
  ([GH-1085](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1085))
- **Stop point_at from passing an off-screen element, and land it mid-frame** —
  `point_at` was documented as the capture-time assertion that catches a wrong
  screenshot, but `bounding_box()` returns coordinates for anything laid out,
  so below-the-fold targets — the normal state of most of a long page — sailed
  through. It now scrolls, settles and asserts against the viewport, and
  centring replaces "anywhere in view", since a target flush against the bottom
  edge passes the assertion and is still the worst place to point
  ([GH-1129](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1129),
  [GH-1144](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1144))
- **Let a settings-file read reach a surface that works** — `rg` against
  `~/.claude/settings.json` prompts while the same verb elsewhere runs clean:
  `~/.claude` is deliberately not a registered working directory, so the
  harness's path-scope gate fires and no allow rule can suppress it — and the
  prompt's second option grants unprompted edits to the file governing every
  other permission decision. The shape is now hook-blocked with the two
  sanctioned surfaces named, and a doctor strategy catches an option 2 accepted
  in an earlier session
  ([GH-1140](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1140))
- **Keep the working tree clean after a test run** — `command-skill-map.msgpack`
  was tracked in git but is a cache the loader rewrites whenever it is stale, so
  any test run, hook invocation or MCP call dirtied the tree; on one PR it rode
  into an unrelated fixup commit and produced a binary rebase conflict with no
  meaningful resolution. Untracked, alongside `.coverage.*` fragments, at the
  cost of a one-time ~15ms cold parse
  ([GH-1075](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1075))
- **Let the base branch report a real CI verdict** — the `create_pr` tests never
  stubbed the branch-detection seam, so their verdict depended on which branch
  CI checked out: green on a feature branch, 16 failures on every push to
  develop. That made develop's Actions signal worthless — the state in which a
  genuine regression goes unnoticed
  ([GH-1124](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1124))

### Documentation

- **Contain an MCP surface loss without a human** — an overnight run lost MCP
  three ways and the docs described one: the top-level case ended the run's
  merge queue until a human ran `/mcp`, and a dropped `update_pr` was silently
  lost, so a worker believed a PR body it had never written.
  `references/mcp-connectivity.md` is now the one home for all three surfaces,
  the watchdog gets its own recovery path at the merge gate, and the
  caller-side rule — a write is a request, not a receipt — is stated where
  every caller sees it. Reconnect-on-demand is closed as unbuildable here: the
  dying hop is harness-owned
  ([GH-1099](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1099),
  [GH-1072](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1072),
  [GH-1121](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1121))
- **Stop a takeover from discarding the work it saves** — the watchdog's STALL
  step 3 named respawn unconditionally, while a respawned isolation worker gets
  a fresh worktree, so a chunk that died holding uncommitted work lost all of
  it silently — the replacement reporting success on a tree it cannot see
  ([GH-1110](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1110))
- **Stop one gate from steering into the next** — the harness blocks a
  standalone `sleep` and recommends a Monitor until-loop, the exact shape the
  watch-loop rule flags as un-allow-listable, so an agent obeying the first
  hint lands on the second gate. The compensations now lead with the shapes
  that do not prompt
  ([GH-1132](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1132))
- **Spare an orchestrator from re-proving a worker's merge** — a worker that
  cannot fire an ALWAYS_ASK gate hands its nine-check report up, and the
  re-invocation contract made the orchestrator re-run all nine, validating every
  swarm merge twice for 3-4x duplicated tool traffic. A bounded handoff
  exception accepts the commit-graph and worker-local checks against a head SHA,
  while CI and all three comment checks stay fresh
  ([GH-1093](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1093))
- **State what the permission layer and the poll budget actually do** — the
  execution-order diagram gave precedence as deny/allow/ask while the cited
  section gave deny/ask/allow, and two places claimed catalog tiers are merged
  by `ensure-base`, which never happens. Separately `poll_until_terminal`'s
  docstring gave a poll budget that was neither its own formula's product nor
  the real ceiling, and had already misled one investigation. Also corrected:
  the upgrade-cleanup Modes table, which omitted the `ensure-base` step from
  bootstrap and dropped five "full only" steps
  ([GH-1095](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1095),
  [GH-1104](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1104),
  [GH-1127](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1127))
- **Let workers pin a sibling worktree with `git -C`** — the redundancy rule
  lived inside two mode branches and was never stated as a rule, so a worker
  carried "never `git -C /path`" as a blanket ban and hesitated to use the one
  shape that reliably works when CWD has reset
  ([GH-1089](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1089))

## 0.95.0 — Unattended-Run Hardening & Tracker-Aware Seeding

Released 2026-08-28

### Features

- **Seed the tracker a project actually uses** — `ensure-base` seeded the
  Linear MCP rules unconditionally, so a Jira or GitHub-Issues user
  collected ~35 inert `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__*` allows and 5 inert denies
  while their own tracker's tools still prompted on first use. The
  tracker→rules mapping now lives in the shipped catalog keyed by tracker,
  resolved from a durable `tracker:` key persisted by `pin_tracker` (repo-stem
  keyed, so one answer covers every worktree) and reported back rather than
  silently applied. GitLab and ClickUp stay out — an empty block would read
  as support that is not there
  ([GH-768](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/768))
- **Prove QA evidence shows what the test cases claim** — a green capture run
  proved only that the code ran: a step guarded by a silent
  `if locator.count() > 0:` no-opped without failing, so blank screenshots and
  content-free videos published straight to an append-only ticket trail.
  Every artifact is now verified before publishing (size floor, uniform-frame
  check, three frames sampled per video), the upload is gated on a local
  approve / re-capture / abort review, and the recording overlay moved out of
  prose into an importable, tested module installed via `add_init_script` so
  it survives navigation
  ([GH-1086](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1086))
- **Attribute a stall to its worker and wake the merge gate** — stall detection
  read the newest mtime across the whole run directory, so a foreman writing
  its own status hid every silent worker behind it; three sat quiet 87–92 min
  before the alarm fired. Escalations had the mirror problem — the disk record
  was authoritative but had no reader, so three MERGE REQUESTs waited hours.
  Each `status-*.md` is now timed and rate-limited separately, and
  `escalations-*.md` is tailed from an arm-time byte cursor with every MERGE
  REQUEST / ESCALATION line re-emitted verbatim
  ([GH-1064](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1064),
  [GH-1060](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1060))
- **Let read-only project queries run unprompted** — listing an org project's
  items to build a work queue stopped on an approval prompt whose "don't ask
  again" suggestion offered `gh project *`, a rule that also admits the delete
  verbs. The four read verbs ship pre-approved; every board-mutating verb keeps
  prompting, the way `gh run` and `gh workflow` are already stratified
  ([GH-1078](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1078))
- **Let unattended cleanup delete local branches unprompted** — an overnight
  crew tidying up after killed workers hit a confirmation prompt on
  `git branch -D`: an ask-bucket entry was shadowing three existing allow
  rules, and ask outranks allow. At 3 a.m. that is a silent wedge, not a
  safeguard, and deleting a local branch removes a ref rather than history. The
  family is pre-approved, and a new `ask-shadows-allow` doctor strategy reports
  any ask/deny rule outranking a same-family allow
  ([GH-1067](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1067))

### Fixes

- **Let the CI wait absorb the polling it promises to absorb** —
  `ci_check_status(wait=true)` ended its wait on the blended verdict, which
  flips to `failing` the moment ANY check fails, required or not. With
  `claude-review` red org-wide during a night run, every call returned
  instantly with three legs still pending — an unactionable verdict the caller
  could only answer by hand-polling, the exact work the wait exists to remove.
  Remaining legs now settle first (`wait_out_pending`, default true), while a
  failed REQUIRED check stays terminal on sight
  ([GH-1065](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1065))
- **Let a posted disposition actually clear the merge gate** — Check 1b
  promised a keyed `Re: comment <id>` reply disposes of the finding it
  answers, but `is_reply` tested the whole body against `^[[:space:]]*Re:` and
  jq anchors that at the start of the STRING. The documented gh-pr-respond
  shape opens with a preamble line, so every disposition posted to satisfy the
  gate RAISED the blocking count by one. `Re:` now matches per line
  ([GH-1057](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1057))
- **Ensure a force push to a protected branch is refused** — GH-1047 closed one
  evading spelling; six more remained, including a force push to `main` on its
  canonical spelling, because the shell loop overwrote `remote` with both
  positionals whenever the remote was actually named `origin`. Both guards now
  count positionals, skip value-taking flags, treat a leading `+` as force,
  unqualify `refs/heads/<x>`, locate `push` relative to a `git` token, and fail
  closed on shell expansion — what the guard cannot read, it must not clear
  ([GH-1049](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1049))
- **Stop a script guard from blocking talk about the script** — the DX006
  `git-push-safe-script` rule guards a script path, but patterns are searched
  against the whole command string, so every command that merely NAMED the
  script was denied — and the block named `push_safe` as the remedy, which can
  neither lint nor move a file. An opt-in `match_position: invocation` matches
  only tokens naming a program being run, with env prefixes stripped in both
  spellings and the choice carried through the msgpack cache
  ([GH-1084](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1084))
- **Stop steering a file search into a dead end** — the shell-write validator
  read `find … -printf '%p\t%s\n' 2>/dev/null` as a `printf` redirect and
  steered to Write/Edit, which cannot enumerate files; diag-friction then routed
  the rejected `find` to `Glob`, which answered "No such tool available". A
  leading `-` now reads as a flag, every use-tool compensation carries a
  `fallback:`, and Step 3g verifies the recommended tool exists in this session
  ([GH-1087](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1087))
- **Let crew workers test their CWD mode instead of guessing** — three artifacts
  told a worker three different absolute rules about Bash CWD, and each was
  wrong at some spawn depth: the crew template mandated `git -C <worktree>`,
  the background preamble forbade it, and validate-bash DENIES `git -C <path>`
  when CWD already equals that path. Worker B1 wedged at fetch/rebase for ~2h
  and two takeovers. Persistence is not a property of being a subagent, so the
  fixed spelling is replaced by a self-test — `cd` then `pwd` as separate calls
  — with the mode declared in heartbeat 1
  ([GH-1050](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1050))
- **Prevent crew workers wedging on unsanctioned tool shapes** — Bash `find`
  over parenthesised route-group paths, a lost MCP connection after ~60 minutes
  read as "operation impossible", and a bare `pre-commit` linting the
  dispatcher's tree each wedged unattended workers with no hook-log trace. The
  crew template mandates Glob over Bash `find`, retries the ToolSearch
  bootstrap once, and carries a `{{lint_shape}}` placeholder;
  `uv run --directory <wt> pre-commit` is allowed as the only shape that
  reaches the intended worktree
  ([GH-1059](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1059),
  [GH-1066](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1066))
- **Stop three gates from blocking on their own false readings** — the merge
  gate refused PRs over severity words in comments that said the opposite ("No
  CRITICAL issues found") and missed an unmarked Review Summary wrapper, so
  supersedes never engaged; `set-friction` wrote a worktree entry shadowing the
  repo's, silently dropping `human_review`, which fails toward true; and the
  gh-issue-comment rule answered its own block with a hint naming a shape the
  same rule blocks
  ([GH-1054](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1054))
- **Tell the operator which key is holding the merge gate** — a night run
  composed adaptive + [solo-maintainer, afk] froze on its first merge with
  `floor:human_review overrides preset:adaptive`. The floor is right — no
  session overlay may lift a durable project fact (ADR-0019) — but the operator
  had no way to learn that a project key, not the preset, was holding it, at
  02:00 with nobody to ask. Floors with a remedy now name it and the file it
  lives in; action floors stay remedy-free
  ([GH-1056](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1056))
- **Stop re-litigating allows the maintainer accepted** — the shape-only auditor
  reported `Bash(git reset --hard:*)` as REDUNDANT beside `Bash(git reset:*)`
  and proposed removing the very rule `ensure-base` re-adds, so
  plugin-maintenance steps 4 and 10 undid each other every run. Accepted
  findings are now recorded (shipped defaults plus a user
  `~/.config/Dev10x/accepted-findings.yaml`), still computed and shown under
  "Suppressed by accepted-findings" but no longer proposed, scoped to named
  classification tokens so one acceptance cannot silence a different finding
  ([GH-1053](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1053))
- **Keep web build shapes off the Bash layer** — `run_node_tests` reads as a
  test wrapper, so its build/check siblings kept running on the Bash layer even
  though GH-1029 gave the tool a `script=` parameter covering them. In an
  unattended subagent an unmatched shape that prompts is a silent wedge: worker
  B2 posted "starting SvelteKit UI" and made zero tool calls for 80+ minutes.
  A `node-build-scripts` map entry steers those shapes, listed after
  `node-tests` so first-match-wins keeps `npm run test` on the test rule
  ([GH-1052](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1052))
- **Let a local test run stay readable on any hardware** — the startup baselines
  were recorded on the CI runner, and developer hardware varies enough to make
  them unreachable (~135 ms against a 37 ms baseline, failing identically on a
  clean `origin/develop`). Three permanently-red tests teach every reader that
  a red `bench` means "the baselines again" — the exact state in which a real
  regression goes unnoticed. A breach now fails in CI and warns locally, with
  `DEV10X_BENCH_STRICT=1` to opt in
  ([GH-1080](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1080))

### Refactoring

- **Prevent per-session audit label accumulation** — every audit-file run minted
  a fresh `audit-YYYY-MM-DD` label; 26 had piled up. The date duplicates the
  session date already in each issue body, and milestone bundling supersedes
  their grouping value, so the category is retired while `skill:<name>` and
  topical labels stay
  ([GH-1070](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1070))
- **Let the maintainer merge their own PRs without a prompt** — the git-tracked
  `merge: ask` pin assumed a team repo needing a human merge through the PR UI,
  a premise `settings-pr-merge.yaml` (`solo_maintainer: true`) no longer
  matches. The pin is removed and the file kept with the rationale rewritten,
  since an absent file is indistinguishable from one that never existed
  (self-motivated)

### Docs & Guidance

- **Ensure pre-flight proves the gates the watchdog needs** — Phase 0.4
  enumerated only the crew's command shapes, so the merge gate's own policy was
  never resolved, the watchdog's CI and triage commands were never proven, and a
  worker could learn a check went red with no sanctioned way to read why. Each
  froze a night run. Pre-flight now dry-runs `resolve_gate(gate="merge")` with
  three honest remedies, routes watchdog reads to wrappers, and proves the
  failing-check log, dependency-install, and worktree-cleanup shapes
  ([GH-1051](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1051),
  [GH-1058](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1058),
  [GH-1062](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1062))
- **Stop crediting a lock the foreman harness does not have** — the tool-surface
  doc argued the merge gate holds because workers cannot reach it. Only half
  true: `merge_pr` is an ordinary deferred tool a worker can load itself, and in
  the audited run one did, and merged. What actually holds the line — the prompt
  contract plus the omission of `merge_pr` from the crew select-query — is now
  named, with the unenforced path recorded as a known gap. The merge gate must
  read each `Fixes:` line against the diff, the overseer must paste its own
  `ci_check_status` output before any MERGE REQUEST, reverting delivered work
  counts as a scope cut, and a takeover brief carries a mandatory manifest
  preface
  ([GH-1061](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1061))
- **Size fanout waves to the host, not just the concurrency cap** —
  `max_concurrency` caps CPU and API concurrency, but each isolated agent also
  carries its own worktree checkout and process footprint; a wave sized purely
  to that cap drove the host into memory pressure, and the mass-resume that
  followed recreated it. Host memory is named as a wave-sizing input, and a
  mass-resume is stated to be a dispatch that waves like any other
  ([GH-1068](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1068))

## 0.94.0 — Force-Push Rails & Config-Path Convergence

Released 2026-08-25

### Features

- **Enable shipped defaults to reach every install** — the userspace catalog
  shadowed the shipped one: `resolve_config` returned the first existing
  candidate, so a `projects.yaml` created once by `permission init` hid every
  safe default shipped after it, while `ensure-base` validated against the
  stale copy and reported success. The only signal a user got was a permission
  prompt at point of use. Rules now merge as shipped + additions − suppressions
  at load time, a suppression naming a shipped deny is refused, and
  `permission catalog-diff` reports drift
  ([GH-912](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/912))
- **Enable non-test package scripts inside the wrapper** — `run_node_tests`
  hardcoded the test script, so a `lint:tsc` check fell back to a raw `tsc`
  invocation on the Bash layer, outside the wrapper's guardrails and into the
  brace-expansion block no allow-rule can suppress. `script=` and `env=` are now
  accepted; only the package managers resolve a script name, and jest/vitest
  fail loud rather than ignoring it. Bundled with a durable
  `protected_branches` pref for `push_safe` and a bounded merge-gate
  Remaining-issues scan
  ([GH-1029](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1029),
  [GH-1031](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1031),
  [GH-1011](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1011))
- **Enable keyless Google Chat auth via SA impersonation** — orgs enforcing
  `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` cannot download service-account keys,
  which blocked `gchat-send` setup entirely; even where keys are allowed they
  are long-lived credentials that never expire. gcloud ADC can now impersonate
  the Chat bot's service account through the IAM Credentials API, minting
  short-lived `chat.bot` tokens with no key ever created. The `sa_key` keyring
  flow remains the implicit default
  ([GH-1032](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1032))

### Fixes

- **Prevent agents executing unvalidated database writes** — the read-only SQL
  gate exempted psql wrapped by `docker exec` or `op run` unconditionally, so a
  wrapped `-c "DROP DATABASE"` cleared every check; three destructive writes ran
  against tt-pos despite a SELECT-only contract. The documented last line of
  defence was inert too, because `should_run()` gates on `_QUICK_TOKENS` and of
  the write verbs only CREATE contains one. The wrapped invocation's SQL is now
  checked, getopt bundles and attached values are parsed, `-f`/`--file` counts
  as a write, and `pg_terminate_backend`/`pg_cancel_backend` are blocked
  ([GH-1034](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1034))
- **Let foreman workers reach their own worktree** — crew workers were told
  their CWD persists across Bash calls; in Agent-spawned subagents it resets
  every call. Workers found git operating on the dispatcher's tree, improvised
  `git --git-dir=…`, and wedged on a prompt nobody could answer overnight — and
  a pending prompt records neither a block nor a denial, so the only symptom was
  a heartbeat stall: ~2h and two takeovers to detect
  ([GH-1028](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1028),
  [GH-1025](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1025))
- **Surface worker git prompts while the supervisor is there** — Phase 0.4
  proved the CLI shape, MCP wrappers, the subagent ToolSearch surface, and
  per-domain test tools, but never a git command in the worktree-pinned shape a
  worker actually runs. The probe came back fully green and two workers still
  died later on git permission prompts, at an hour when a prompt is
  unanswerable and leaves no denial trace
  ([GH-1030](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1030))
- **Prevent a bundled force flag skipping the push rail** — the skill-redirect
  hook lets a push bypass the rail when it names a non-protected branch and
  carries no force flag, but the force half tested whole tokens only: POSIX
  short-flag bundling meant `git push -uf origin feature-branch` sailed through
  as an ordinary push. Short-flag clusters are decomposed letter-by-letter in
  both the validator and `git-push-safe.sh`, while long options stay on the
  exact-match path so `--force-with-lease` never matches on a substring
  ([GH-1047](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1047))
- **Protect staging from the hook-layer push escape hatch** — GH-1031
  reconciled three statements of the protected-branch default, but a fourth
  lived in `branch_name.py` as `frozenset(BASE_BRANCH_PRIORITY)`, which omits
  `staging` — so a push naming `staging` slipped through a guard the
  shell-level default does protect. The two lists answer different questions
  ("what does a PR target?" vs "what does nobody force-push?"), which is why
  they drifted; both are now commented and pinned by test
  ([GH-1041](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1041))
- **Let XDG config be the one place Dev10x prefs live** — GH-941 rehomed tier-2
  user config to `~/.config/Dev10x`, but playbook discovery still resolved
  overrides exclusively from the retired memory tree and `slack-notify`'s
  `CONFIG_PATH` had drifted to a path nothing has ever written. Docs kept
  naming the retired tree, sending users to write config where nothing reads it
  ([GH-1045](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1045))
- **Ensure one DoD criteria file governs every checkout** — `verify-acc-dod`
  read its override criteria from the retired `~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/` path
  while the documented home was `~/.config/Dev10x/`, so a maintainer editing
  the documented copy saw no effect. The guard rule shipped for GH-948 covered
  only the ADR-0018 retirement, so both stale lines scanned clean
  ([GH-1035](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1035))
- **Give one posture one answer across gates and modes** —
  `legacy_session_mapping` maps `active_modes` to gate overlays and never back,
  so a repo migrated to `gate_preset` + `gate_overlays` read as solo-maintainer
  to `resolve_gate` and as nothing at all to every `active_modes` consumer: on
  the same PR, `request_review` resolved to skip while `verify-acc-dod` reported
  "Review requested — 0" as a failing check
  ([GH-1003](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1003))
- **Allow a fixup when one commit owns every branch hunk** — the resolver
  classified `single` only with zero orphan hunks, so any orphan promoted the
  result to `multi` and callers aborted, printing "restage per owning commit"
  against an owner list holding exactly one commit. Adding an import beside its
  first usage produces that shape every time. Classification now counts
  distinct owning commits alone, reporting `orphan_hunks` for visibility
  ([GH-1042](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1042))

### Docs & Guidance

- **Settle whether git restore sits inside the checkout rail** — a truncated
  worktree was repaired with `git restore` after `git checkout HEAD --` was
  denied, and doctrine had no clear answer: the substitution table forbade the
  swap, nothing said the rail covered the successor spelling, and the shipped
  baseline allows both. The rail covers the outcome, so it covers
  `git restore`; corrupted-tree recovery stays a supervisor-run procedure, with
  an unattended route that abandons the tree rather than repairing it
  ([GH-1039](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1039))
- **Record rejection of the plugin split** — a full dependency scan of all 87
  skills falsified ADR-0020's premise: the work-on closure spans 32 skills
  across five of the seven planned areas, so the satellites are not
  independently installable and only infra and data (4 skills) were severable.
  ADR-0020 is marked Rejected with the measured rationale, the SPLIT initiative
  prefix retired, and light-audience needs routed to a playbook profile
  ([GH-913](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/913),
  [GH-1013](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1013))

## 0.93.0 — Review Posture & Durable Session State

Released 2026-08-04

### Features

- **Let a project's review posture decide reviewer assignment, DoD checks
  and merge autonomy from one answer** — `review-deferred` was written to
  the `session.yaml` ADR-0018 retired, so in any configured repo the flag
  was written and never read: verify-acc-dod re-ran the very checks the
  supervisor had just deferred, and the write cost a consent prompt for no
  effect. Whether humans review PRs is now a standing project property
  (durable `human_review`, ADR-0019), read by reviewer resolution, both DoD
  review checks, and — as a gate floor rather than a skill-side check — the
  merge gate, so a repo declaring humans in the loop can never watch the
  agent merge for itself
  ([GH-950](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/950),
  [GH-1000](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1000))
- **Carry a self-review clearance beyond the session that granted it** — a
  supervisor answering "I reviewed it, OK to merge" had that answer
  recorded nowhere, so the next session re-entered the gate on the same PR
  and asked again. A `pr_labels` MCP tool (`list`/`add`/`remove`, shaped
  like `pr_comments`, both writes idempotent) carries a durable per-PR
  `review:cleared` label — and git-groom drops it after a force-push, since
  a sign-off covers only the commits that were read
  ([GH-1008](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1008))
- **Park work without paying a consent prompt** — five skills still wrote
  the ephemeral task index under a repo's `.claude/`, the exact trigger for
  Claude Code's self-settings consent gate that no allow rule suppresses.
  So every park, Slack reminder, PR bookmark and wrap-up paid a prompt. The
  index moves to `~/.config/Dev10x/task-index/<repo-stem>.yaml` behind
  `task_index_get`/`_append`/`_set` — keyed off the git common dir, so one
  index serves a repo and all its worktrees — with the retired path read
  and folded forward for one release
  ([GH-1009](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1009))
- **Warn before the quota wall so the queue parks first** — the watcher
  reported spend only after the fact, so nothing projected whether the
  remaining block budget could still carry the active crew; two workers
  burned into exhaustion and were misread as harness stalls for two hours.
  A forward-looking `QUOTA LOW` event fires once per block when projected
  exhaustion lands inside the chunk window, with the documented response
  (land a chunk one merge away, else WIP-checkpoint and park until
  `QUOTA RESET`) and the crew-wide-silence signature that distinguishes
  exhaustion from a per-worker stall
  ([GH-979](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/979))

### Fixes

- **Restore issue comments to every caller** — `issue_comments` died with
  "dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 11" because the script
  emitted a bare JSON array that `to_dict()` then ran `dict()` over. The
  failure was data-dependent, not unconditional: an issue with no comments
  yielded `[]`, which became a silent `{}` — callers read "no comments"
  from an equally broken payload. The unwrap is dropped, and non-object
  JSON now fails loud at the parse layer naming the offending script
  ([GH-993](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/993))
- **Let a pinned gate policy reach an agent worktree** — `friction.yaml`
  entries are keyed off the git common dir but matched against the
  invocation toplevel, and a linked agent worktree's directory name matches
  neither glob. The repo's pinned walk-away policy silently evaporated and
  the merge gate fell back to an `ask` wall at exactly the step an
  unattended run needs automated. Policy resolution now probes the worktree
  first and falls back to the repo root the entry was keyed by
  ([GH-978](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/978))
- **Give a stand-by PR an exit that is not an argument** — a repo
  configured `standby: true` had no way to say "I have now reviewed this",
  so the only exit was to argue the override down again on every PR. The
  path now asks, offering stand by / reviewed and OK to merge / reviewed and
  request the team now, and points a repo answering the same way repeatedly
  at the durable posture it actually wants
  ([GH-998](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/998))
- **Dispose of a review finding on whichever surface it lives** — the
  merge gate's answered-ids set was computed per-surface, so a keyed reply
  posted as an issue comment never matched a finding in a review body. A
  blocking review-body finding was unaddressable through sanctioned tooling
  — the only exits were rewriting the reviewer's own body or bypassing the
  gate. Both surfaces are now unioned before filtering
  ([GH-1002](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1002))
- **Route permalink rewrites through the sanctioned tool** — git-groom
  hardcoded a raw REST PATCH for rewriting commit permalinks, carrying a
  suppression marker that claimed no MCP edit action existed. GH-304
  shipped `pr_review_comment_edit` and made that stale, but the marker kept
  the lint quiet, so an agent following the skill literally still issued
  raw API calls until a supervisor rejected them
  ([GH-996](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/996))
- **Rebase a background agent onto the base that actually moved** — the
  standing guidance prescribed `git develop-rebase` as THE rebase tool for
  background agents, but `-i` hangs with no editor attached and the
  merge-base resolves against a possibly stale LOCAL ref, so it printed
  "Successfully rebased" while HEAD never left stale ancestry. Every
  prescription now names the explicit `fetch` + `rebase origin/<base>` pair
  plus a mandatory ancestry postcondition, since the success message is not
  proof; `foreman probe` also labels its base sha `origin/develop` so a
  reader can tell which ref they got
  ([GH-964](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/964))
- **Read a shell script without the execution guard firing** — a read-only
  `grep -E 'a|b' bin/x.sh` was denied as script execution: the alternation
  split the pipeline mid-quote and the fail-closed fallback matched the
  `sh` in the *filename*, so the guard fired hardest exactly when
  diagnosing a defect inside a shell script. The fallback now requires the
  interpreter in command position
  ([GH-971](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/971))
- **Keep the canonical lint suite green with worktrees present** — the
  dependency-pin hook full-repo scans by design, and its skip list omitted
  worktrees, each a complete checkout of the same repo. Every finding was
  re-reported once per tree, so leftover agent worktrees failed lint
  repo-wide: observed with 44 trees, a two-file `pre-commit run --files`
  emitted thousands of violations from paths the change never touched —
  blocking unattended crew commits outright
  ([GH-1004](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1004))

### Security

- **Close the command-substitution hole in the interpreter guard** — only
  start-of-string, pipe, semicolon, ampersand and newline counted as
  command boundaries, so `echo $(python3 <<< '...')` and its backtick twin
  slipped past: the guard saw the leading `echo`, and shlex tokenises
  `$(python3` as one word so the pipeline scan could not help. Both
  substitution spellings are now boundaries on the heredoc and fail-closed
  paths, with read-only utilities inside a substitution asserted still
  allowed ([GH-986](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/986))
- **Let an unattended agent push a finished branch when MCP is down** —
  with the cli server unreachable, `push_safe` was absent, the wrapper was
  blocked with "use the MCP tool", and raw `git push` was blocked with "use
  Skill(Dev10x:git)" — each message naming the other as the remedy, and the
  documented resolution assuming a human is present to ask. A non-force
  push naming an explicit, non-protected branch is now allowed straight
  through; the deny stands for anything the hook cannot verify statically
  ([GH-963](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/963))

### Docs & Guidance

- **Tell a stalled crew worker apart from a dead one** — the 2026-08-01
  night run killed five live, productive workers, throwing away two
  complete chunks, because heartbeat mtime cannot separate "wedged" from
  "absorbed in a long turn" and nothing preempts a model mid-turn to check
  a clock. The heartbeat is re-anchored to observable events (commit, test
  run, push, verification) with the clock demoted to a backstop, and
  `TaskStop` reserved for heartbeat *and* tool-call activity both stale;
  the sonnet caveat is recorded so the tier default reads as risk
  reduction, not immunity
  ([GH-967](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/967),
  [GH-966](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/966))
- **Give the night shift the references its harness assumed** — five
  reference docs close gaps each rediscovered the expensive way:
  `overseer-discipline.md` (an idle agent cannot heartbeat, so
  "passive wait + heartbeat" ends as a false STALL — heartbeat, ONE bounded
  blocking wait, heartbeat, act), `durability-envelope.md` (only pushed
  commits and issue comments survive a session death; transcripts do not),
  `worktree-recovery.md` (`EnterWorktree` into a sibling worktree reports
  success then wedges the subagent's Bash permanently — loud, but too late
  to be a safe probe), `roster.md` (a single-writer at-a-glance table of
  every delegated chunk, explicitly a derived rendering), and the
  spawn-by-request inversion where the watchdog becomes the crew's parent
  ([GH-962](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/962),
  [GH-965](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/965),
  [GH-977](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/977),
  [GH-976](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/976),
  [GH-972](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/972))
- **Find the night loop without scrolling past explanatory depth** —
  `foreman/instructions.md` had grown to 585 lines with the
  execution-gating parts buried, and its INDEX.md override entry described
  neither the real size nor the already-extracted split candidate. Depth
  moves to four new reference files behind named pointers; the loop,
  handshake, crew contract and red-flag tables stay inline
  ([GH-987](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/987))
- **Trust the docs about where session config lives** — ADR-0018 retired
  the per-repo `session.yaml`, but the schema reference still taught
  readers to create one, work-on forbade the write and then instructed it,
  and git-worktree guarded a seed on a file nothing creates any more. Every
  read and write site is repointed at the durable prefs
  ([GH-1001](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1001))
- **Let a groom's own steps land on pre-approved shapes** — git-groom
  opened Phase 1 with bare `git log`/`git merge-base` calls it never
  declared, so both cost a rejected Bash call, and Phase 1 read as a direct
  contradiction of work-on's never-self-assess rule. The two shapes are
  declared, `origin/<base>`-qualified forms are primary, and the groom
  prohibition is scoped to the orchestrator
  ([GH-997](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/997))
- **Survive a force-push at the merge gate** — a force-push resets a
  published PR to draft, so an earlier `pr_ready` (including
  `create_pr(draft=false)`) proves nothing by the time the gate runs. Check
  3 now requires `pr_ready` after the FINAL push plus a fresh `isDraft`
  read, and mid-body `Closes #N` lines are documented as informational
  only — the `Fixes:` trailer is what closes an issue on merge
  ([GH-958](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/958))
- **Author this repo's own `.claude` docs unattended** — the self-settings
  consent gate fires on the Write/Edit family for any path under
  `.claude/`, regardless of matching allow rules, and an unattended worker
  cannot answer a prompt. Since the gate is bound to the tool rather than
  the path, crew workers stage content outside `.claude/` and move it into
  place, with `settings*.json` and `.claude/Dev10x/**` hard-excluded.
  Recorded as a stopgap: the upstream fix is narrowing the gate
  ([GH-1004](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1004))
- **Offer an HTML artifact for reports a human actually reads** — long
  comparison-shaped reports wrap badly as transcript markdown.
  `references/html-artifact-reporting.md` makes an artifact an option for
  exactly those cases, with markdown still the default and a hard guard
  that no completion gate may depend on an artifact existing
  ([GH-974](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/974))

## 0.92.0 — Night-Shift Discipline & Dependency Bounds

Released 2026-08-01

### Features

- **Require a deliberate commit to adopt a breaking dependency** — the
  GH-914 trap (an unbounded `mcp` requirement silently taking down both
  MCP servers) existed in ~30 other uv-scripts. A shared
  `dependency_pins` detector now scans every PEP 723 header and
  `pyproject.toml` dependency array for a missing upper bound, wired into
  the canonical pre-commit suite, with bounds backfilled across every
  hook, server and skill script
  ([GH-916](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/916))
- **Surface pins that have gone stale instead of waiting for breakage** —
  pinning shifted the failure mode from silent breakage to silent
  staleness. `dev10x deps sweep` asks PyPI for each distribution's
  current stable release and reports pins whose upper bound now excludes
  an available major; a weekly workflow runs the same subcommand and
  opens an issue when the report is non-empty
  ([GH-937](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/937))
- **Fail CI when a REQUIRED gate ships without gate-enforcement evals** —
  a new eval-gap detector plus CI workflow and a standing skill-audit
  Wave 1 check closes the hole where a documented `AskUserQuestion` gate
  could be silently replaced with plain text. The CI scan is diff-scoped
  so pre-existing gaps do not block unrelated PRs, and coverage was swept
  onto every gated skill — 0 gaps across 87 skills, was 7
  ([GH-835](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/835),
  [GH-940](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/940),
  [GH-885](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/885),
  [GH-783](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/783))
- **Make a Phase-0 preset choice stick for the whole repo** — a preset
  picked at the session-adoption gate evaporated at session end, so every
  stale session re-asked and hand-authoring `friction.yaml` was the only
  way to make it durable. `pin_gate_preset` / `preset_pin_status` derive
  the key from the git common dir, so a pick made inside worktree
  `<repo>-3` also covers the main checkout and a `<repo>-9` created
  later — and nothing is written under any repo's `.claude/`
  ([GH-855](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/855))
- **Route an audit finding to the tracker of the plugin that shipped the
  skill** — skills from every installed plugin live under
  `~/.claude/plugins/`, so skill-audit Phase 7 could not tell whose skill
  a finding was about and either dropped it or misfiled it at the Dev10x
  repo. `resolve_plugin_origin` maps a skill path to its owning
  marketplace and source repo, with a REQUIRED gate confirming the
  destination and no guessing when the origin is unresolved
  ([GH-816](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/816))
- **Retire a superseded PR through a routed call** — `pr_close` mirrors
  `issue_close`'s shape so closing a stale PR is one MCP call instead of
  a raw `gh pr close` fallback, and `issue_close` now fails loud with
  "N is a pull request; use pr_close"
  ([GH-924](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/924))
- **Let an unattended watchdog see only events needing a decision** — the
  foreman watcher dedupes `BASE MOVED` echoes of the run's own merges and
  mutes quota/stall spam behind a parked flag, docs name both CLI shapes
  (`dev10x` vs `uv run dev10x`), and Phase 0.3 defaults to the
  adaptive+afk auto-advance composition rather than re-asking
  ([GH-946](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/946),
  [GH-947](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/947),
  [GH-944](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/944))

### Fixes

- **Keep a guard firing when the command is reformulated** — rule
  patterns match command-name prefixes with `re.search`, so a git global
  option between the executable and the verb broke substring adjacency:
  `git -C <path> push --force` matched no rule and pushed. That reads as
  "the check passed" rather than "the check was evaded", and it affected
  all 42 catalog rules. Global options are now normalized before
  matching, fixing every rule at once; `pr_ready` also gains `undo` so
  returning a PR to draft — the safe direction — has a sanctioned path
  ([GH-931](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/931))
- **Give the merge gate an exit once a bot finding is answered** — Check
  1b promised a finding was addressed once a later comment replied to it,
  but the scan never mapped a reply back to the finding it answered, so
  `blocking_count` never returned to 0. Replies now dispose of findings
  by comment id on the `Re:` line, keyed rather than prose-fuzzy, and
  `gh-pr-respond` emits the id so both skills agree on the contract
  ([GH-907](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/907))
- **Stop hiding a comment from reading as a disposition** — Gate 6
  auto-advanced to minimizing a resolved finding, which looks like it
  should clear Check 1b. It cannot: the scan consumes the REST
  issue-comments array, which carries no `isMinimized` field, so an agent
  following the gate to the letter still landed on `blocking_count: 1`.
  Minimization is now marked cosmetic everywhere it appears
  ([GH-920](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/920))
- **Produce a hygiene-clean PR body on the first try** — generated bodies
  recurrently tripped the hygiene bot: the Job Story sometimes lacked the
  `**so … can**` marker, and the checklist separator was emitted *after*
  the `Fixes` trailer, so every body ended with a bare `---`. `create_pr`
  now refuses a job story missing a marker and names it, and `update_pr`
  moves trailing content above the trailer
  ([GH-945](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/945))
- **Keep Slack review requests landing without `slack_sdk`** — the send
  path imported the SDK unconditionally and turned an `ImportError` into
  a dead end *after* `prepare` had already reported `ready: true`. The MCP
  server process does not always run where the declared dependency was
  installed, so every message path now falls back to a stdlib `urllib`
  POST using the token already resolved — making `ready: true` truthful.
  The privacy inventory documents the direct `slack.com/api` calls, with
  a test pinning the exemption to the policy entry that justifies it
  ([GH-917](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/917))
- **Discover MCP tools from an installed plugin, not just a checkout** —
  `permission enumerate-mcp` walked up from `__file__`, which lands in
  site-packages from an installed wheel, so the catalog came back empty
  and printed "No Dev10x MCP tools discovered" — indistinguishable from a
  genuine no-op. Any stale wildcard was left in place and the run still
  exited 0. A single `resolve_plugin_root()` resolver now covers the
  installed plugin cache, and a discovery failure exits 1
  ([GH-919](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/919))
- **Keep a perl substitution rule valid through canonicalize** — `doctor
  canonicalize` collapsed every `//` outside a `://` scheme, so an inline
  `perl -pe 's/…//g'` allow rule lost a delimiter and was rewritten into
  a syntactically invalid expression. The collapse is now scoped to path
  contexts and skips quoted interpreter bodies
  ([GH-918](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/918))
- **Get the right worktree from the worktree wrappers** — invoked from a
  session whose CWD is itself a linked worktree, `create_worktree` let
  optionals land in the repo-root positional slot and
  `next_worktree_name` computed the parent relative to the current
  worktree. The parent now resolves via `--git-common-dir`, and
  `create-worktree.sh` gains a real base-ref positional
  ([GH-960](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/960))

### Security

- **Keep an App JWT off the process command line** — app-auth calls
  shelled out to `gh api -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>"`, leaving the
  token readable via `ps` / `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` for the child's
  lifetime. Both calls now go through an in-process stdlib HTTPS client,
  so the JWT never reaches a subprocess argv
  ([GH-499](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/499))

### Refactoring

- **Keep durable gate prefs outside the repo entirely** — `Dev10x:afk`
  still wrote `.claude/Dev10x/config.yaml`, which ADR-0018 retired and
  GH-818's migrate-config deletes — a migrate/recreate loop charging a
  self-settings consent prompt on every invocation. Nothing guarded it,
  because the cli-friction scanner skipped YAML front matter where the
  authorizing grant lived. Reads now go through `preset_pin_status`,
  writes through `dev10x session set-friction`, and a new scanner rule
  covers front matter so the retired path cannot be smuggled back
  ([GH-948](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/948))

### Docs & Guidance

- **Give a crew worker the discipline it can actually reach** — the crew
  contract named `Skill()` calls no Agent-spawned subagent can invoke. A
  worker told to merge via `gh-pr-merge` could not reach it, fell back to
  a raw merge, and landed a PR squashed against the documented rebase
  discipline: the 9-check gate was imaginary at exactly the moment it
  mattered. The lifecycle now splits at the MCP boundary — workers
  bootstrap MCP wrappers via ToolSearch and stop at PR-open; merging
  moves to the watchdog, the one role that can invoke the gate
  ([GH-922](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/922))
- **Open a handshake before taking a stalled agent's work** — a tripped
  `STALL` now messages the agent with every completed action and requires
  a STOP-ACK plus a second silent heartbeat window before TaskStop; any
  reply is evidence of liveness and the agent is resumed instead of
  replaced. Flat spend is explicitly rejected as corroborating evidence
  of death, and `status-<chunk>.md` is worker-owned so a third-party
  write cannot forge the mtime the detector reads
  ([GH-923](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/923))
- **Admit what a respawn cannot reach** — a respawned worker gets a fresh
  isolation worktree, so a dead worker's uncommitted work is unreachable
  to it, and cross-worktree copies fail silently while reporting success.
  Respawn now recovers a chunk, never a tree, and a chunk that stalls
  twice with the same shape gets a different model tier on the third
  attempt rather than a more directive brief
  ([GH-957](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/957))
- **Start a crew worker in the right, clean worktree** — a spawned
  subagent inherits its dispatcher's CWD, so "you are already in your
  worktree, do not `cd`" was false for every parallel wave: one worker
  implemented a whole fix on the wrong branch, another never got
  traction. The template now opens with a cd-and-verify preamble and
  bakes in the dirty-worktree recipe verbatim — prose guidance failed in
  the field where the literal five-step recipe worked
  ([GH-959](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/959))
- **Prove the shapes a night run needs before arming it** — two Phase 0
  gaps burned pre-flight window on consecutive runs. The `dev10x` CLI
  shape now resolves from a table covering the plugin-cache install where
  bare `uv run` picks the wrong project, and any chunk whose deliverable
  is an executable artifact must have that artifact dry-run during the
  window — otherwise a worker meets a permission prompt at 02:00 and
  improvises a banned-shape workaround
  ([GH-961](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/961))
- **Write Job Stories in the project's own language** — localized story
  guidance for non-English tickets, pointing at Cucumber's Gherkin
  language reference for derived keywords
  ([#901](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/pull/901))

## 0.91.0 — MCP Pin Recovery & Judgment-Tier Discussion

Released 2026-07-30

### Fixes

- **Keep MCP servers loading when a new mcp major publishes** — both
  server entry points declared an unbounded `mcp>=1.0` in their PEP 723
  blocks, so every invocation resolved the newest release. When mcp 2.0
  dropped `mcp.server.fastmcp`, both servers died at plugin load and
  sessions started with no Dev10x tools, skills, or agents at all. The
  range is now pinned to `mcp>=1.0,<2` across both servers, the dev
  extra and the wheel smoke install, with a test rejecting any
  unbounded mcp requirement so the trap cannot reopen
  ([GH-914](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/914))
- **Keep `Dev10x:investigate` on plugin-owned skills** — the skill
  routed PR review to `pr:review`, a user-level skill that exists only
  on one machine, so the documented path silently fell through for
  every other install. Review now delegates to `Dev10x:gh-pr-review`
  ([#909](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/909))

### Features

- **Let the supervisor pick the model tier for ddd discussion agents** —
  solo facilitation hard-coded haiku personas, and in a real workshop
  that produced naive output: generic policies with no
  interaction-level thinking, where the same prompts on a frontier
  model surfaced actionable compound-failure scenarios. Discussion
  agents do judgment work, so the fetch/prep cost-tiering rationale
  does not apply — a REQUIRED model-tier gate now runs once per
  session and applies to both persona rounds and the devil's advocate
  ([GH-789](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/789))

### Infrastructure

- **Parse read-only config uniformly** — `rule_engine.py` and
  `platform/registry.py` read YAML with no error handling, so a
  malformed or missing file raised straight into the PreToolUse hook
  path while sibling readers degraded to `{}`. A shared
  `domain/common/config_io.py` (ADR-0015) now provides tolerant-by-
  default `load_yaml`/`load_json` with a strict mode raising a single
  `ConfigIOError`, and the fragmented readers route through it
  ([GH-828](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/828))
- **Keep `~/.claude` path resolution behind ClaudeDir** — a few direct
  `Path.home() / ".claude"` constructions lingered after GH-575/GH-80,
  re-scattering home resolution and bypassing the
  `DEV10X_CLAUDE_HOME` test override. The remaining sites now use the
  accessors, and an AST ratchet test fails on any new home-relative
  join outside them
  ([GH-829](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/829))

### Docs & Guidance

- **Plan the commit sequence before implementing** — a bundle of seven
  work-on findings: refactor-first commit planning in the feature and
  structured-spec plays, a documented subagent implementation model
  (disjoint-file partition, one parallel wave, no concurrent shared-DB
  test runs), merge-state checks before re-monitoring CI or rewriting
  history, a review-thread re-scan after human reviews, reuse of
  git-commit's 72-char validation when grooming, and a new
  `dev10x spec drift` CLI so SPDD gates run where inline python is
  blocked
  ([GH-904](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/904))
- **Stop afk runs freezing on self-opened gates** — an overnight run
  surfaced three orchestration gaps: a handoff-answered
  `AskUserQuestion` freezes the run (answer inline instead), afk must
  check the ALWAYS_ASK allowlist before self-initiated gates, and a
  no-watcher foreman should merge directly on green rather than
  rebasing a non-conflicting PR into CI ping-pong
  ([GH-903](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/903))
- **Create JIRA tickets reliably and own the k8s skill in-plugin** —
  `ticket-create` claimed Atlassian writes were pre-approved when they
  prompt as outward-facing mutations, so they cannot run from a
  background agent; the k8s skill lived only in one user's local
  skills dir behind a broken wrapper path. It ships as `Dev10x:k8s`
  with plugin-relative paths and the read-only kubectl wrapper
  ([GH-899](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/899))
- **Frame JTBD actor wants as outcomes, not work** — guidance still
  allowed the desire clause to read as effort ("the customer wants to
  pay online"), but nobody wants to run a transaction, and framing the
  mechanism as the want misidentifies both actor and beneficiary.
  Transactional effort verbs are now discouraged alongside UI verbs,
  with a "happiest doing nothing" heuristic and a money-movement
  worked example
  ([GH-902](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/902))
- **Bless `load_*` and `read_*` as data-retrieval names** — the naming
  rule sanctioned only `get_*`/`fetch_*`, while 33 functions across the
  package already used `load_*` for config parsing and `read_*` for
  file I/O with no documented standing. Both are now first-class
  conventions, `fetch_merged_prs` is a documented exception, and
  existing names must not be rename-swept
  ([GH-830](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/830))

## 0.90.0 — Google Chat Notifications & Unattended Delivery

Released 2026-07-20

### Features

- **Deliver PR review requests to Google Chat alongside Slack** —
  reviewers who watch Google Chat had no equivalent of the Slack
  review ping. A full transport slice now posts through a private
  Chat bot: config and service-account key resolution from the OS
  keyring, RS256 JWT access-token minting on the existing
  pyjwt + stdlib stack (no new dependency), message posting, and the
  `Dev10x:gchat` (send) and `Dev10x:gchat-review-request` skills with
  human-approval and draft guards mirroring the Slack pair
- **Enable unattended overnight milestone delivery** — long
  unattended runs died on permission stalls: an inline watch loop in
  a Monitor command once froze the supervisor session for seven hours
  while crew workers hung on blocking CI waits. The new
  `Dev10x:foreman` skill plus `dev10x foreman probe|watch` CLI give a
  two-tier watchdog/foreman/crew harness where every watcher lives
  behind one pre-approved command enumerated while the supervisor is
  present, and cut scope always survives harness loss by persisting to
  tracker issues
  ([GH-890](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/890))
- **Guide per-project friction setup at session start** — gate policy
  silently fell back to a preset for any repo without an explicit
  `friction.yaml` entry, so a project could run an autonomy posture
  the supervisor never chose. SessionStart now seeds a strict baseline
  when the file is absent, nudges when the project is unmatched, and
  the new `Dev10x:friction-setup` skill walks the supervisor through
  choosing gate and playbook axes
  ([GH-886](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/886))
- **Report the active usage block offline via dev10x cli** — agents
  reached for `npx ccusage` to read the active 5-hour usage block,
  which hard-prompts on every worktree and cannot be allow-listed. A
  native `dev10x usage blocks --active --json` command and pre-approved
  `usage_blocks` MCP tool provide the capability at source, parsing
  `~/.claude` usage JSONL with a bundled offline rate table
  ([GH-878](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/878))
- **Strengthen orchestration and merge-gate reliability** — a bundle
  of six skill-audit findings across work-on, fanout, gh-pr-merge,
  verify-acc-dod, gh-pr-create and gh-pr-request-review: armed
  auto-merge detection, plan-branch refresh on branch change,
  warn-and-ignore unknown gate context, non-resumable user-killed
  agents, a mandated full-suite gate before DONE, and a solo-maintainer
  adaptive completion gate
  ([GH-848](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/848))
- **Enable milestone re-open and editing via MCP** — re-opening a
  closed milestone was the only milestone mutation with no wrapper,
  forcing a raw `gh api PATCH`. New `milestone_reopen` and
  `milestone_edit` tools close that gap and satisfy the no-raw-gh-api
  rule
  ([GH-850](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/850))
- **Steer inline watch loops to pre-approved watchers** —
  structurally un-allow-listable `while`/`until`/`sleep` and
  `watch -n` shapes are matched exactly like Bash even as Monitor
  commands, so one prompted watch froze an orchestrator turn for
  seven hours. An advisory rule now routes them to `dev10x foreman
  watch`, `~/.claude/tools` scripts, or `ci_check_status`
  ([GH-879](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/879))
- **Route npm monorepo tests through run_node_tests** — the
  `npm --prefix <dir> test` shape stacked four friction sources with
  no single allow-rule. A hook-block rule now steers the monorepo
  forms to `run_node_tests(cwd=DIR)`
  ([GH-880](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/880))

### Fixes

- **Harden shared-state writes against concurrency (ADR-0011 wave)** —
  a bundle closing the gaps the ADR-0011 concurrency wave left behind:
  the rule-confidence store now holds a lock across load→mutate→save
  and writes atomically, the doubt-sink appends via a single
  `atomic_append_line`, the settings-migration apply pass re-reads
  under lock so a racing edit is never overwritten, gh/git subprocess
  calls in five polling scripts are bounded with timeouts, the dead
  `ConfigYamlDocument.write` path is retired, and reviewer checklists
  now enforce file-locks + timeouts on new stores and subprocess calls
  ([GH-822](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/822),
  [GH-823](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/823),

  [GH-827](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/827))

### Testing

- **Close eval and unit-test gaps on orchestration surfaces** — add
  evals for gh-pr-monitor and gh-pr-request-review, the ddd workshop
  skill, parametrized unit tests for session_rules policy decisions,
  and per-package coverage floors for domain, validators, config,
  spec, audit, hooks and skills
  ([GH-831](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/831),
  [GH-832](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/832),
  [GH-833](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/833),
  [GH-834](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/834))

### Docs

- **Adopt third-person domain-actor Job Story voice** — Job Story
  guidance mandated first-person voice, hiding the concrete domain
  role behind the need. The canonical reference and all skill docs now
  require a third-person actor + beneficiary, with "Choosing the
  Actor" and localized-story guidance added
  ([GH-847](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/847))

## 0.89.0 — Surface Silent Plugin-Load Failures

Released 2026-07-16

### Features

- **Warn when the Dev10x plugin was silently skipped at session start** —
  a startup race between concurrent sessions can leave Claude Code
  loading the session without the Dev10x plugin, and because no plugin
  hook fires nothing warns the user until a skill invocation fails. The
  race is upstream and unfixable from here, but it no longer stays
  silent: the SessionStart orchestrator writes a per-session load
  marker, and a userspace `plugin-load-guard.sh` that runs even when the
  plugin was skipped points the user to `/plugin reload` when the marker
  is absent
  ([GH-874](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/874))

## 0.88.0 — AFK Session Robustness & Permission-Policy Completion

Released 2026-07-16

### Features

- **Complete the Permission-As-Policy platform with an auditor and a
  resolver** — PAP-3/4/5 shipped `auditor_assessment`,
  `resolve_effect(context=)`, and `load_policy_layers` as tested
  surfaces with no production caller. `dev10x permission audit` now
  classifies allow rules (OVERLY_BROAD, WILDCARD_ESCAPE, HOOK_ENABLED,
  REDUNDANT) through the shared renderer, `dev10x permission resolve`
  resolves an effect with skill context off the layered tiers, and the
  seven ad-hoc `Bash(...)` regex parsers are unified behind `AllowRule`
  and `Policy`
  ([GH-819](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/819),
  [GH-841](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/841),
  [GH-867](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/867),
  [GH-868](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/868))
- **Migrate legacy per-repo config into the global friction.yaml** —
  ADR-0018 retired `.claude/Dev10x/config.yaml` but PR #815 shipped only
  a lazy read fallback, so existing repos kept working while their
  durable prefs never migrated and the stale files lingered. An
  agent-driven upgrade-cleanup step now folds a repo's legacy durable
  keys into a `friction.yaml` `projects[]` entry and removes the stale
  files once parity is confirmed
  ([GH-818](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/818))
- **Gate git-groom Strategy B on target shape before rebuilding** — Full
  Restructure reached the intended commit shape only after several
  destructive re-groom passes because the skill guessed the shape and
  iterated. A pre-rewrite AskUserQuestion gate now elicits the
  shape-defining constraints up front, a hook-safe N-commit
  reconstruction recipe replaces the improvised path, and a backup tag
  plus tree-equality diff gate the force-push
  ([GH-860](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/860))
- **Stop prompting on safe branch deletes under AFK** — `git branch -d`
  still prompted during fanout worktree teardown even though git refuses
  it for any unmerged branch. The stratified safe-delete forms are now
  synced into the flat `projects.yaml` catalog that ensure-base deploys,
  while the destructive `-D`/`--force` form stays behind the prompt
  ([GH-864](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/864))
- **Keep work-on artifact delivery ahead of embedded questions** —
  work-on could latch onto an inline question as the primary task and
  stop instead of keeping artifact delivery as the goal. A Phase 1 rule
  now treats a question alongside an artifact target as context, and a
  pure-question fallback fires only when there is no artifact target at
  all
  ([GH-865](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/865))
- **Prevent short-closing a Fixes-linked issue at merge** — a Fixes:
  link auto-closes its issue on merge regardless of how much of the
  stated scope the diff delivers, so a narrower slice could close the
  issue short. A new verify-acc-dod scope check and gh-pr-merge Check 1d
  compare the linked issue's scope against the diff before merge
  ([GH-856](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/856))

### Fixes

- **Restore file-write pre-approval via Edit() rules** — recent Claude
  Code versions no longer honor `Write(path)` permission rules or skill
  allowed-tools; only `Edit(path)` matches, and it covers all
  file-editing tools. `Write()` is converted to `Edit()` across the
  baseline catalog, the upgrade-cleanup seed, and ~18 skill
  allowed-tools blocks, and a doctor `rewrite` deprecation migrates
  already-seeded user rules
  ([GH-862](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/862))
- **Unblock AFK bot-to-bot review cycles and fix review order** —
  bot-authored threads still forced supervisor prompts, the reviewer's
  own round summary false-blocked the merge gate, and Code review ran
  before any commit existed. Threads now carry `author_type` and
  auto-delegate to gh-pr-respond when every unresolved thread is
  bot-authored, the jq filter scans only "Remaining issues", and the
  shipping pipeline commits before review
  ([GH-858](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/858))
- **Restore branch and task list on session resume** — a mid-work-on
  restart lost the visible TaskList and reported the base branch instead
  of the feature branch. `branch` is now a reserved `set_context` key
  that mirrors to the banner's top-level metadata, and a work-on Phase
  0.5 step rebuilds the TaskList from the persisted plan on a detected
  resume
  ([GH-861](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/861))

### Performance

- **Speed up the unresolved-threads sweep at scale** — the repo-wide
  sweep fired ~2 gh subprocesses per merged PR and timed out at scale.
  Batching PRs into chunked GraphQL queries via field aliasing (25 per
  request) and folding the audit-marker fetch into the same query drops
  ~400 subprocesses to ~9
  ([GH-836](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/836))
- **Speed up pr_notify with concurrent PR fetches** — three independent
  gh fetches ran serially (3× latency per monitor tick). New
  `PRStatusSnapshot`/`PRNotificationContext` value objects run the calls
  concurrently via a thread pool and make the formatters testable
  without a live PR
  ([GH-839](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/839))

### Internal

- **Consolidate the 2026-07-10 architecture-audit polish** — a run of
  archetype-alignment and testability refactors from the audit: gate
  resolution split into a testable query object, the ensure-* CLI folded
  behind a shared runner, the gh wrappers unified behind a run-and-parse
  skeleton, gate conditions made data-driven, plugin loading shared
  across validators and doctor, the Plan terminal-task invariant pulled
  into the aggregate, domain archetypes aligned, and the `skills/`
  directory added to `.gitignore`
  ([GH-837](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/837),

## 0.87.0 — Permission-As-Policy Re-Platform & Session-State Relocation

Released 2026-07-11

### Features

- **Re-platform the permission catalog onto typed Policies** — two
  catalogs had drifted apart (the flat `base_permissions`/`base_denies`
  lists that `ensure_base` ships and the grouped, tier-tagged
  `baseline-permissions.yaml`), and permission rules carried provenance
  but had no engine to resolve conflicting layers. Every flat rule is now
  a `Policy` with lifecycle, scope, owner, and assessments; a
  forbid-wins, project > user > plugin resolution engine (`ask` beats
  `allow` inside the deciding tier) answers which effect governs a
  signature; and `ensure_base`, worktree seed/merge, doctor, and
  settings.json rendering all operate on the Policy set. A golden-corpus
  regression net gates the refactor and settings output stays byte-parity
  with the pre-PAP lists — the one intended diff is home-dir twin
  expansion for `~/` rules
  ([GH-797](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/797),
  [GH-798](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/798),
  [GH-799](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/799),
  [GH-800](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/800),
  [GH-801](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/801),
  [GH-802](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/802))
- **Enable gate-free session prefs via a global friction.yaml** — writing
  `.claude/Dev10x/{session,config}.yaml` with the Write/Edit tool tripped
  Claude Code's self-settings consent gate on every session regardless of
  allow rules, and per-repo durable prefs never synced across a repo's
  worktrees. Durable prefs now live in a global
  `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml` keyed by project dir-path globs; the
  ephemeral `session.yaml` is deleted and the adoption/staleness gate
  reads branch/tickets from plan-sync; work-on Phase 0 and the
  post-checkout templates no longer write per-repo session state (ADR-0018)
  ([GH-812](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/812))
- **Guard skill docs against runtime `.claude/` writes** — with session
  state relocated out of a repo's `.claude/`, a new `write-guard-claude`
  rule flags `Write/Edit/MultiEdit(...)` calls whose path is under
  `.claude/`, scanning prose (not just shell fences) since the
  instruction is typically plain text, with the standard
  `# cli-friction: allow` opt-out
  ([GH-817](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/817))

### Fixes

- **Stop plugin-maintenance silently skipping worktrees** — worktree
  discovery only scanned `<root>/.worktrees/*`, so a project whose
  worktrees live elsewhere (still registered in `git worktree list`) was
  skipped entirely while the run reported success. Discovery now unions
  the `git worktree list --porcelain` set with the `.worktrees/` glob and
  the merge-worktree CLI echoes discovered coverage so a gap is visible,
  not implied
  ([GH-813](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/813))

### Docs

- **Record the 2026-07-10 A–I architecture audit memo** — the nine-phase
  project audit produced 37 findings that existed only as agent
  transcripts; they are now consolidated into one findings memo,
  reconciled against the 2026-06-10 memo, and re-verified against
  `origin/develop` after a parallel session merged the PAP and
  session-relocation work past the audited baseline
  ([GH-481](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/481))

## 0.86.0 — Drift-Free Session Config & Merge-Gate Hygiene

Released 2026-07-09

### Features

- **Split session config into durable and ephemeral state** — a single
  gitignored `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml` conflated durable repo prefs
  (`friction_level`, `active_modes`, `gate_*`) with ephemeral
  per-worktree state (branch, tickets), so every write tripped Claude
  Code's self-edit gate and worktree provisioning carried stale
  branches. Durable prefs now live in a copied-by-post-checkout
  `config.yaml`; ephemeral state stays in a hook-seeded, read-only
  `session.yaml`, with transparent migration from a pre-split file
  ([GH-774](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/774))
- **Guard against stale high-autonomy modes bypassing gates** — a
  copied-forward `active_modes: [solo-maintainer]` could silently skip
  request-review and external-notify repo-wide. A local, gitignored
  `allowed_overlays` allow-list in `config.yaml` now filters overlays at
  the `resolve_gate` boundary (dropping only removes autonomy, never
  weakens a gate) and warns at SessionStart when a durable mode is
  dropped ([GH-805](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/805))
- **Keep the working tree clean during Dev10x sessions** — runtime
  artifacts under `.claude/Dev10x/` surfaced as untracked and tripped
  the clean-tree gates in `verify_pr_state`, gh-pr-merge, verify-acc-dod,
  and `create_pr`. The session seed now writes a directory-wide
  `.gitignore`, superseding the earlier per-file ignore
  ([GH-809](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/809))
- **Surface non-blocking findings and CI-infra outages** — INFO-level
  bot recommendations in COMMENTED/APPROVED review bodies were invisible
  to the merge/monitor comment gates, and `ci_check_status(wait=true)`
  collided with the MCP idle-timeout during hosted-runner outages. The
  gates now bucket blocking vs. needs-disposition findings and a distinct
  `infra_unavailable` verdict is returned when checks never register
  ([GH-808](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/808))
- **Handle bot findings cleanly at the merge gate** — skip `Re:` replies
  and strip quoted context before the severity scan, add a
  `pr_review_edit` wrapper to rewrite a submitted review body, and add a
  `pr_ready` wrapper to un-draft a PR so CI-suppressed drafts stop
  stalling the monitor
  ([GH-777](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/777),
  [GH-778](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/778),
  [GH-779](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/779))
- **Reflect live PR state in DoD checks** — a local-only plan that
  resolved "create PR" mid-run silently skipped the CI, draft, fixup,
  review-thread, and review-request checks. verify-acc-dod now re-infers
  the feature check set when an open PR is detected and surfaces the
  re-inferred checks in the results table
  ([GH-780](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/780))
- **Surface stale session carryover before resuming** — session-wrap-up
  now stamps its resume payload with branch, tickets, and a `wrapped_at`
  timestamp, and classifies carried park-discover entries as live vs.
  stale so a months-old task list is no longer re-surfaced as current
  ([GH-782](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/782))
- **Give bootstrap permission consent an informed disclosure** — the
  onboarding bootstrap now surfaces the state-changing subset (git, gh,
  script execution, settings) before the permission-approval gate so a
  cautious new user can see what they are about to grant
  ([GH-769](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/769))

### Fixes

- **Enable prompt-free session-config writes** — exact-path Read/Write/
  Edit rules for `session.yaml` and `config.yaml` join the unreliable
  `.claude/Dev10x/**` globs in base_permissions and propagate to every
  `settings.local.json`, so a normal run no longer re-prompts on
  git-derivable state
  ([GH-790](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/790))
- **Restore PR-monitor CI status reporting** — the status report crashed
  because `gh pr checks --json` no longer accepts `conclusion`; it now
  requests the normalized `bucket` field and guards duration math against
  gh's zero-time timestamps
  ([GH-773](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/773))
- **Ensure background-agent reports reach the orchestrator** — named
  background agents delivered only an idle notification, losing every
  report; dispatch templates now deliver the report via `SendMessage`
  with a documented escalation ladder
  ([GH-776](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/776))
- **Prevent duplicate Verify-AC tasks in the local-only play** — the
  play-level Verify-AC is now conditioned to the no-PR path so exactly
  one terminal gate instantiates on either path
  ([GH-781](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/781))

### Performance

- **Tier Claude CI review models** — the code-review orchestrator now
  runs on sonnet and dispatches one haiku subagent per matched domain
  for the bulk per-rule review, and `anthropics/claude-code-action` is
  pinned to a commit SHA across all four Claude workflows

### Docs

- **Record ADR-0017 for the mode-guard policy location** — `allowed_overlays`
  is a personal-machine trust preference in gitignored `config.yaml`, not
  a git-tracked pin; documents the defense-in-depth split from the
  separate `.dev10x/gate-policy.yaml` project pin
  ([GH-805](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/805))
- **Document rule-documentation standards from consolidation review** —
  guidance on when to expand reviewer checklists, when to document
  exceptions, and checklist formatting
  ([GH-788](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/788))
- **Remove the GH-774 scoping spec merged into develop by mistake** —
  `docs/specs/GH-774.md` shipped in 0.84.0 via a mistakenly-merged draft
  PR; the implementation now supersedes it (forward delete, no history
  rewrite) ([GH-774](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/774))
- **Capture PR #382 lessons-learned implementation notes**

## 0.85.0

Released 2026-07-08

Mechanical version-alignment release — no functional changes since
0.84.0.

## 0.84.0 — DDD Workshop Foundations & Capability-Based Authz Probes

Released 2026-07-07

### Features

- **Ground the DDD workshop in researched domain knowledge** — the
  `Dev10x:ddd` skill shipped with 11 loosely-sourced archetypes and no
  pattern / anti-pattern / standards guidance; it now carries a
  21-signal archetype catalog across four source families,
  design-pattern / anti-pattern / authz / integration guides, a 30+
  standards map with a verified bibliography, and solo-facilitation
  tooling (blind persona panel, devil's advocate, `[ASSUMPTION]`
  guardrail) as the documented default. Shared knowledge moves to
  `references/domain/` for reuse by `project-audit`, the architect
  agents, and `adr-evaluate`
  ([GH-771](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/771))
- **Probe capability-based authz in workshops** — the authz reference
  covered only account-centric models (RBAC/ABAC/ReBAC); a new
  bearer-invitation model adds a Capability row to the grant-sentence
  and decision-guide tables plus a Step 2b with eight probe questions
  (scope, forwardability, attenuation, expiry, redemption identity,
  delegation, revocation, leak blast radius), grounded in W3C
  capability URLs and Macaroons
  ([GH-771](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/771))

### Docs

- **Scope the session.yaml durable/ephemeral split** — design for
  separating durable session state from ephemeral state without
  tripping the clean-tree gates
  ([GH-774](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/774))
- **Prevent implementation-flavored Job Story drafts** — jtbd guidance
  keeps Job Stories situation-driven rather than implementation-flavored
  ([GH-786](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/786))
- **Keep the ddd SKILL.md budget override honest** — corrected the
  documented line count for the ddd skill's budget override
  ([GH-771](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/771))

## 0.83.0 — Data-Driven Friction Gate Policy & Light-AFK Presets

Released 2026-07-04

### Features

- **Tune friction per gate with a data-driven policy** — per-gate
  friction policy backed by a `resolve_gate` resolver tool and
  gate-policy foundations
  ([GH-742](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/742),
  [GH-752](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/752))
- **Run light-AFK with human-gated merges** — a guided AFK preset that
  auto-advances mechanical steps but keeps merge human-only; `afk`
  recomposed as an adaptive+afk preset
  ([GH-748](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/748),
  [GH-759](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/759))
- **Detect bot top-level and review-body comments** — recognize bot
  top-level and review-body comments, and warn on contradictory
  oversight modes at the adaptive level
  ([GH-743](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/743),
  [GH-744](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/744))
- **Guard against premature completion while a PR is unmerged**
  ([GH-729](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/729))
- **Enforce the empty-task-list invariant**
  ([GH-681](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/681))
- **Override merge for blocked PRs with admin/auto**
  ([GH-733](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/733))
- **Offer ripgrep/Grep when `find -exec` search is blocked**
  ([GH-726](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/726))
- **Show the work-on plan structure as a box-drawing tree**
  ([GH-730](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/730))
- **Enable the request-review stand-by widget at guided**
  ([GH-758](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/758))

### Fixes

- **Fix top-level bot-comment detection (identity vs signal)**
  ([GH-764](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/764))
- **Honor deferred review threads at the completion gate**
  ([GH-736](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/736))
- **Resolve stale permission `--init` references**
  ([GH-741](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/741))

### Performance

- **Speed up single-PR unresolved-thread checks** — a single per-PR
  `reviewThreads` GraphQL query replaces the merged-PR sweep
  ([GH-710](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/710))

### Refactors

- **Route gates through the friction resolver** — work-on,
  gh-pr-respond, and merge/commit/monitor gates now resolve through
  the shared friction resolver; batch-gate auto-advance keys on comment
  author and respond short-circuits on an already-merged PR
  ([GH-755](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/755),
  [GH-756](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/756),
  [GH-757](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/757),
  [GH-745](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/745),
  [GH-744](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/744))
- **Simplify duplicated bulk, restore, and regex helpers**
  ([GH-583](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/583))

### Docs

- **Converge friction docs on the resolver, deprecate `walk_away`**
  ([GH-760](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/760))
- **Unblock config-loader consolidation via a read-I/O ADR**
  ([GH-536](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/536))
- **Document script-domain-boundaries enhancements** — reviewer
  checklist and config-loader exception guidance from PR #382 lessons
  ([GH-246](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/246))

### Tests

- **Prevent tests from rewinding the real repo HEAD**
  ([GH-699](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/699))

## 0.82.0 — Unattended JIRA Tickets, Worktree Session Seeding & Prefix-Friction Fixes

Released 2026-06-26

### Features

- **Create JIRA tickets unattended** — `Dev10x:ticket-create`'s JIRA
  path dispatched a background agent that stalled on the Atlassian MCP
  write-tool permission prompt; a new `mcp-atlassian-write` tier-2
  baseline group pre-approves the six non-destructive JIRA write verbs
  (create / edit / comment / link / transition / worklog, no deletes),
  routes the JIRA branch through `createJiraIssue`, and pins the
  GH-593 write-precedence override as a deliberate, audited exception
  ([GH-631](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/631))
- **Carry session config across worktrees without dirtying the tree** —
  `session.yaml` is work-on session state, but git-tracking it tripped
  the clean-tree gates in `verify_pr_state`, `Dev10x:gh-pr-merge`
  Check 5, and `create_pr`, while gitignoring it broke continuity in
  new worktrees; `dev10x session seed` now does an idempotent O_EXCL
  write of a default, post-checkout templates copy or seed it, and a
  new `Dev10x:session-config-seed` skill wraps the CLI for agent-time
  delegation ([GH-705](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/705))

### Fixes

- **Stop recommending unreliable `**` path wildcards** — the permission
  tooling rewrote version-pinned plugin paths into `**` wildcards, but
  `**` matching proved unreliable in the permission engine; the two
  canonicalize deprecations are dropped, `canonicalize_rule` is
  narrowed to the GH-704 `//` collapse, and regression tests assert no
  `**` is ever emitted
  ([GH-715](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/715))
- **Prevent `git -c` prefix friction** — a `git -c <key>=<value>`
  prefix shifts the matched command string so `Bash(git <verb>:*)`
  never fires; DX007 now blocks the prefix, routes `core.pager` /
  `color.ui` to `git nopager` / `git nocolor` aliases, treats
  `core.hooksPath` as a safety block, and routes the
  `core.editor` / `sequence.editor` rebase form to a plain
  `git rebase --continue`
  ([GH-717](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/717),
  [GH-720](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/720))
- **Prevent `uv run`/`uvx pre-commit` prefix friction** — the wrapper
  shifts the matched command string so `Bash(pre-commit run:*)` never
  fires; DX007 now blocks it and routes to the bare `pre-commit` form
  ([GH-717](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/717))

### Tests

- **Cover the PR lifecycle skills and MCP tools** — eval coverage for
  `gh-pr-review`, `gh-pr-merge`, and `gh-pr-triage`, plus unit tests
  for `merge_pr` safety gates, `resolve_review_thread`, and
  `unresolved_threads`
  ([GH-547](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/547))
- **Cover fanout dispatch and worktree wrappers** — `create_worktree`
  error paths, `next_worktree_name` collisions, batch-detection edges,
  and subagent status-protocol parsing
  ([GH-553](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/553))
- **Cover audit/plan MCP error paths** — the `err()`/`{"error": ...}`
  wire contract for the audit tools and `plan_sync` key-conflict,
  archive-race, and CWD-binding paths
  ([GH-556](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/556))
- **Cover the work-on pipeline skills** — evals for `ticket-branch`,
  `session-wrap-up`, and `session-tasks` guarding branch naming, the
  never-empty task-list invariant, and wrap-up routing
  ([GH-560](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/560))
- **Cover the MCP daemon lifecycle** — restart, STDIO fallback,
  deleted-CWD recovery, StreamableHTTP concurrent sessions, and
  session-TTL expiry
  ([GH-563](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/563))

### Docs

- **Prevent stale-base conflicts in bundle and fanout** — work-on
  Strategy B gains a per-batch fetch + rebase-onto-`origin/<base>`
  pre-step and fanout branches each item from a fresh base, both gated
  off once review fixups or unresolved threads exist
  ([GH-626](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/626))
- **Guide full restructure to atomic layer commits** — Strategy B now
  documents commit granularity and cohesion (small atomic layer
  commits, ordered bottom-up), disambiguates "full restructure" from
  squash-to-one, and gates strategy selection by fixup presence
  ([GH-723](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/723))

## 0.81.1 — GitHub MCP Tool Responses & Review-Setup Gate Fixes

Released 2026-06-25

### Fixes

- **Restore GitHub MCP tool success responses** — every github MCP tool
  (`issue_get`, `pr_comments`, `pr_comment_reply`, `detect_base_branch`,
  `verify_pr_state`, …) failed Pydantic output-schema validation in
  0.80.0 despite the underlying GitHub call succeeding; the
  `@github_tool` decorator now pins the wrapper's return type to `dict`
  so FastMCP derives no output schema and accepts the flattened wire
  dict ([GH-712](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/712))
- **Keep gh-review-setup's module gate within the option cap** — the six
  review modules are split across two `AskUserQuestion` questions in one
  call, since each question caps at four options, so the setup gate no
  longer fails with `InputValidationError`
  ([GH-713](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/713))

## 0.80.0 — Continuous Learning Loop, Installable PR-Review Action & Source-Derived Permissions

Released 2026-06-25

### Features

- **Close the review-to-rule learning loop** — recurring PR review
  comments are mined into candidate patterns, scored for confidence and
  false-positive risk, authored into reference rules, and surfaced for
  review, so the system learns from past reviews instead of repeating
  them ([GH-346](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/346),
  [GH-347](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/347),
  [GH-348](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/348),
  [GH-349](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/349),
  [GH-350](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/350),
  [GH-353](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/353))
- **Install Dev10x PR review as a GitHub Action on any repo** — a guided
  setup wires up the reviewer Action, including learned-rule review, on
  repositories beyond this one
  ([GH-351](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/351),
  [GH-352](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/352),
  [GH-707](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/707))
- **Derive permissions from a source two-axis manifest** — a
  source-derived manifest plus proactive seeding grants default-safe
  reads for surfaces like Sentry, JIRA, and Vercel, unifies sensitivity
  classification across surfaces, and seeds rule provenance fleet-wide
  for worktrees, so safe reads stop re-prompting per project
  ([GH-600](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/600),
  [GH-601](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/601),
  [GH-602](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/602),
  [GH-603](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/603),
  [GH-606](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/606),
  [GH-607](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/607))
- **Approve sensitive read probes in-session** — credentialed reads and
  sensitive probes can be approved without dropping to a manual shell,
  and read-only MCP tools can be promoted to global settings
  ([GH-604](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/604),
  [GH-480](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/480))
- **Run node/yarn dev loops off the Bash layer** — `run_node_tests`
  brings jest/vitest/yarn/npm/pnpm test runs through the MCP boundary,
  sidestepping the brace-expansion block no allow-rule could suppress
  ([GH-703](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/703))
- **Run PR-state merge checks without the raw CLI** and **distinguish
  required from advisory CI verdicts**, so merge gating reflects which
  checks actually block
  ([GH-668](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/668),
  [GH-658](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/658))
- **Enable server-initiated LLM sampling** via a `request_sampling` MCP
  tool ([GH-343](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/343))
- **Trust the plan while attending later gates** — background subagents
  stay off hook-tripping command shapes and the supervisor can defer
  attention to later decision gates
  ([GH-678](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/678),
  [GH-610](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/610))
- **Register platforms during onboarding** and resolve skill-script
  paths canonically, with diag-friction routing for four more raw
  command shapes
  ([GH-528](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/528),
  [GH-611](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/611),
  [GH-609](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/609))
- **Establish pre-commit as the canonical lint entry point** — ruff,
  shellcheck, and mypy run through `.pre-commit-config.yaml` as the
  single lint gate
  ([GH-619](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/619))

### Security

- **Close the DX003 interpreter-stdin execution bypass** — piping a
  script into an interpreter's stdin no longer evades the execution
  safety validator
  ([GH-687](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/687))

### Performance

- **Collect release PRs in one batch query** instead of per-PR fetches,
  and reduce git subprocess forks at session stop
  ([GH-550](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/550),
  [GH-552](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/552))

### Fixes

- **Resolve git-fixup misfire on a stale local develop** — the
  fixup-target resolver cross-checks `origin/develop` instead of a stale
  local ref ([GH-676](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/676))
- **Enable closing issues as not planned**
  ([GH-674](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/674))
- **Match plugin skill-script grants across roots and `//`**
  ([GH-704](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/704))
- **Surface hook-denial findings to MCP audit callers** and in default
  installs, so friction-riddled sessions no longer report zero unmatched
  calls ([GH-507](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/507),
  [GH-574](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/574))
- **Fail closed when safety validators raise**, rather than letting an
  exception open the gate
  ([GH-494](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/494))
- **Prevent the daemon from killing the wrong process** and keep the
  roots cache fresh by retaining the refresh task
  ([GH-573](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/573),
  [GH-498](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/498))

### Hardening

- **Close write races across session, settings, and lock state** —
  bounded waits on contended file locks, torn-write protection for the
  applied-version stamp, lost-update protection for `SessionStore.update`
  and settings mutators, and non-interleaving concurrent skill-metric
  lines ([GH-555](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/555),
  [GH-558](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/558),
  [GH-562](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/562),
  [GH-571](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/571))
- **Ensure Slack send failures reach callers** and keep the MCP server
  from crashing on missing config
  ([GH-537](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/537),
  [GH-532](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/532))

### Refactors

- **Enforce the Result contract at the MCP boundary** (ADR-0009) and
  adopt Catalog, Query Object, AbstractHook, and Value Object archetypes
  across the permission, session, github, and validator packages, sealing
  package boundaries and typing the domain models throughout
  ([GH-509](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/509),
  [GH-654](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/654),
  [GH-584](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/584))
- **Consolidate permission config on `projects.yaml`** and centralize
  protected-branch handling, validator dispatch, and session-state
  capture ([GH-577](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/577),
  [GH-583](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/583),
  [GH-635](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/635))

### Tests

- **Enforce default-stage mypy and shellcheck warnings** and strengthen
  the permission-classifier fixture corpus via evidence triage, closing
  CI-hang and reproducibility gaps
  ([GH-619](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/619),
  [GH-271](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/271),
  [GH-614](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/614))

### Docs

- **Document any-repo install and the learning loop**, the accepted App
  JWT argv exposure, and permission-rule generalization patterns
  ([GH-354](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/354),
  [GH-499](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/499),
  [GH-592](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/592))

## 0.79.0 — Permission Friction Reduction, Structured Policy Model & Cross-Fork PRs

Released 2026-06-08

### Features

- **Model permission rules as structured policies** — the flat
  allow-rule string list becomes typed `Policy` value objects carrying
  tier, source, and effect, laying the foundation for the deny catalog,
  user/project source precedence, and worktree forward-sync that the
  GH-271 friction evidence converged on
  ([GH-271](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/271))
- **Close six permission-friction and tooling gaps in one bundle** —
  DX014 matches production hosts by context rather than a bare `prod-`
  prefix (GH-482), `uvx`-launched `skill notify slack-send` declares
  slack-sdk so it actually runs (GH-483, thanks
  [@szx19970521](https://github.com/szx19970521) for surfacing it in
  [#487](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/pull/487)),
  `issue_comment` gains a
  `body_file` arg (GH-484), DX007 normalizes `uv run` env-flags before
  prefix-matching (GH-485), git-groom resolves its base against
  `origin/<base>` instead of a stale local ref (GH-486), and
  project-audit persists its Phase 4 findings memo (GH-481)
  ([GH-481](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/481))
- **See which read-only MCP tools and research domains can go global** —
  `dev10x permission promote-plan` produces a deduped, read-only dry-run
  plan of the claude.ai-hosted tools and WebFetch domains that re-prompt
  per project, so they can move to global settings instead of being
  re-approved in every repo (write tools and plugin-distributed tools
  are never promoted)
  ([GH-470](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/470))
- **Open cross-fork PRs through `create_pr`** — `create_pr` /
  `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` accept an optional head repo, push the branch to
  the fork owner's remote, and emit `--head <owner>:<branch>`, so
  contributing to an external repo from a fork keeps the wrapper's Job
  Story, commit list, summary comment, and notify flow
  ([GH-473](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/473))

### Security

- **Refuse to auto-approve `uv run --with` installs** — `--with <pkg>`
  now disqualifies `uv run` auto-approval, closing a supply-chain hole
  where an allowed inner command silently installed an arbitrary package
  and bypassed the fence-tool ask
  ([GH-485](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/485))

### Fixes

- **Surface hook denials in skill-audit friction reports** — Phase 4 now
  scans the tool-result blocks it previously dropped for
  `permissionDecision: deny` and `BLOCKED:` validator signals, so
  sessions riddled with hook friction no longer report "0 unmatched
  calls"
  ([GH-474](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/474))
- **Allow containerized and 1Password-wrapped psql through the DB gate**
  — the DX004 read-only SQL gate exempts `docker exec … psql` (runs in a
  test container) and `op run -- psql` (the sanctioned secrets wrapper)
  while still blocking bare host psql
  ([GH-474](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/474))
- **Reclaim merged agent worktrees holding replicated dirt** — fanout
  teardown force-removes merged-but-dirty worktrees when their only
  changes are stale or a repo-wide `.claude/` rewrite replicated
  identically across siblings, so leftovers stop piling up
  ([GH-476](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/476))
- **Stop bash/sh/zsh exec from bypassing DX003** — the execution-safety
  guard now covers shell interpreters alongside python3, steering
  `bash /tmp/x.sh` and `sh -c …` to the Write-tool/uv-script path
  instead of relying on an unreliable deny-rule
  ([GH-469](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/469))
- **Run plugin scripts without re-prompting** — plugin-maintenance emits
  concrete version-pinned script rules instead of `**` globs that Claude
  Code's Bash matcher never matches, and purges the dead globs that were
  masking script coverage
  ([GH-471](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/471))

### Docs

- **Document worktree CWD and push discipline** — the git-worktree skill
  now warns that `cd` does not persist between Bash calls and that raw
  `git push` is hook-blocked, steering callers to absolute paths and
  `Skill(Dev10x:git)`
  ([GH-474](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/474))
- **Document the lessons-learned implementation plan** — capture the
  GH-460 plan for harvesting merged PRs and review threads into the
  learning loop
  ([GH-460](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/460))

## 0.78.0 — MCP Client Integration, Swarm Teardown & CI Quality Gates

Released 2026-06-03

### Features

- **Read Dev10x knowledge as addressable MCP resources** — playbooks,
  rules, references docs, and the skill index are exposed under
  `dev10x://` URIs, so MCP clients read them directly instead of
  falling back to Bash tool-calls or filesystem searches
  ([GH-339](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/339))
- **Invoke review, commit, and jtbd templates as MCP prompts** — the
  workflow templates are registered as first-class MCP prompts with
  argument autocomplete, so clients run Dev10x's conventions without
  re-deriving them by hand each time
  ([GH-340](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/340))
- **Keep client resource caches fresh** — a knowledge-resource watcher
  polls the files backing the registered MCP resources and emits
  `list_changed`/`updated` notifications when they change on disk, so
  connected clients refresh instead of serving stale content
  ([GH-341](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/341))
- **See progress on long-running MCP tools** — `run_tests`,
  `mass_rewrite`, `rebase_groom`, and `create_pr` stream progress and
  log notifications when the client supplies a progress token, so long
  operations no longer look like a silent stall
  ([GH-342](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/342))
- **Scope MCP operations to client-declared directory roots** — the
  server fetches and caches the client's `roots/list`, refreshes on
  `roots/list_changed`, and exposes a `list_client_roots` tool so
  skills can validate CWD against what the client considers in-scope,
  with a `DEV10X_ROOTS_ENABLED=0` escape hatch
  ([GH-344](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/344))
- **Tear down swarm worktrees after merge** — fanout now runs a
  teardown decision tree per merged child PR (remove clean worktrees,
  force-remove stale duplicates of develop HEAD, keep and surface
  genuinely unique content), prunes leftovers, and delegates abandoned
  branch cleanup to the new branch-prune skill
  ([GH-463](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/463))
- **Prune stale local branches in rebase-merge repos** — the new
  `Dev10x:git-branch-prune` skill classifies branches into four
  categories (gone-upstream, merged-ancestor, content-landed-via-
  rebase, ahead/undecidable) behind a REQUIRED deletion gate, so
  branch hygiene works in repos where `git branch --merged` misses
  most merged branches
  ([GH-464](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/464))
- **Block performance regressions in CI** — the benchmark suite runs
  on every PR against a cached per-branch baseline and fails on a mean
  regression greater than 20%, so hook-latency and startup regressions
  can no longer ship undetected
  ([GH-432](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/432))
- **Enforce hook-test coverage in CI** — the hooks workflow measures
  coverage against a 70% threshold and the project-wide floor rose
  from a stale 38% to 75%, so coverage discipline is machine-enforced
  rather than agent-dependent
  ([GH-433](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/433))
- **Warn before editing code whose spec is stale** — the experimental
  `DX015` spec-drift validator fires on Edit/Write when the branch's
  ticket maps to an active spec not yet touched in the working set,
  moving the Golden Rule from "skill-if-invoked" to "hook-always"
  (opt-in via `DEV10X_HOOK_EXPERIMENTAL=1`)
  ([GH-434](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/434))
- **Audit skill usage inline by default** — skill-audit's new
  lightweight strategy works from visible conversation context with a
  single disposition gate; the forensic transcript-extraction fan-out
  moves behind `--full` or auto-escalation, so most sessions capture
  findings without a separate terminal
  ([GH-436](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/436))
- **Harvest merged PRs and review threads for the learning loop** —
  fail-soft fetchers turn closed PRs and their inline review threads
  into structured data, feeding downstream clustering and
  candidate-rule scoring without re-scraping GitHub
  ([GH-345](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/345))
- **Find all Dev10x config under XDG paths** — `databases.yaml` is
  discovered at `~/.config/Dev10x/`
  ([GH-448](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/448)),
  global playbook overrides resolve from
  `~/.config/Dev10x/playbooks/`
  ([GH-445](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/445)),
  and upgrade-cleanup migrates both automatically — including configs
  stranded in hidden backup directories
  ([GH-446](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/446),
  [GH-447](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/447))
- **Detect stale running hooks at SessionStart** — the session
  compares the running-hook version against the latest installed
  plugin and nudges for a restart when a mid-session
  `claude plugin update` left shipped friction fixes dormant
  ([GH-407](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/407))

### Fixes

- **Resume dead swarm agents instead of re-dispatching** — fanout now
  prefers SendMessage resume when an agent's turn dies, swarm children
  verify their worktree before any branch checkout, gh-pr-merge runs
  comment checks strictly after CI is green (closing the bot-post
  race), the drift gate no longer offers switching to a deleted
  branch, and canonical MCP parameter shapes are documented to prevent
  first-call validation errors
  ([GH-462](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/462))
- **Survive hostile worktree topologies in fanout** — child worktrees
  stay writable and base-safe (branch-upstream guard prevents bare
  pushes from advancing the base PR), and orchestrators dispatching
  from a sibling worktree detect the cross-repo-root condition and
  fall back to serial mode
  ([GH-424](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/424),
  [GH-427](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/427))
- **Stop full-mode cleanup from reintroducing friction** —
  plugin-maintenance's global-dedup and doctor canonicalize are now
  opt-in (`--aggressive`), preserving the project-local rules and
  literal `~/` paths the permission engine actually needs
  ([GH-420](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/420))
- **Send Slack notifications from any install context** —
  `uvx dev10x skill notify slack-send` calls an importable module
  instead of resolving filesystem paths into `skills/`, so it works
  when installed as a wheel
  ([GH-442](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/442))
- **Recover the MCP server from a deleted process CWD** — when the
  worktree the server was spawned in is removed after a merge, the
  server chdirs to the plugin root instead of failing every
  subsequent subprocess call with ENOENT
  ([GH-418](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/418))

### Refactors

- **Encode friction-level behaviour on the enum itself** —
  `pending_decisions_guidance()` and `fallback_guidance()` replace
  if/elif dispatch chains in the decision-guidance rule and
  skill-redirect message formatting
  ([GH-249](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/249))

### Docs

- **Unified backpressure architecture reference** — a single doc maps
  the two-direction model (action gating + output gates) across every
  hook, validator, and completion-gate surface
  ([GH-435](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/435))
- Rule-index updates for `DX014`/`DX015` and the perf CI gate;
  corrected the investigate skill's Common Mistakes routing table
  ([GH-444](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/444))

## 0.77.0 — Persistent MCP Daemon, Sensitivity-Axis Gating & Live GitHub Contract Tests

Released 2026-06-01

### Features

- **Run the MCP servers as a persistent daemon over HTTP** — a managed
  background daemon adds health checks, graceful shutdown, and
  restart-safe lock handling, per-client session state is maintained
  across StreamableHTTP requests, and a new session-aware client wires
  Claude Code to the running daemon when it is healthy while falling
  back to a fresh per-session STDIO server when it is not, so sessions
  pay lower startup overhead with no manual configuration
  ([GH-336](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/336),
  [GH-337](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/337),
  [GH-338](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/338))
- **Keep MCP tools working after a bound worktree is deleted** — cli
  tool calls now fall back gracefully instead of failing with ENOENT
  when a worktree is removed after a branch merge, so `mktmp` and the
  other MCP tools keep working in post-merge sessions instead of
  hitting "Current directory does not exist"
  ([GH-410](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/410))
- **Gate commands that touch sensitive targets** — a new orthogonal
  sensitivity axis classifies actions against secrets, credentials,
  PII, and production infrastructure, and the `DX014` validator blocks
  and asks for review before executing even trivially-reversible reads
  that the tier and reversibility axes alone would let through
  ([GH-406](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/406),
  [GH-395](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/395))
- **Catch GitHub GraphQL/REST field drift before it reaches sessions** —
  a live contract-test tier exercises the GitHub-backed MCP read tools
  (`pr_get`, `pr_comments`) against the real REST/GraphQL surface and a
  known fixture PR, and queries are validated against the published
  GraphQL schema, so invalid fields and response-shape drift are caught
  in CI instead of forcing a downstream session to fall back to raw `gh`
  ([GH-398](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/398),
  [GH-386](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/386))
- **Smoke-test a release candidate before tagging** — the release flow
  now builds and installs the wheel locally, prints the real remote
  side effects before the irreversible tag, and requires a live
  `--plugin-dir` run for changes that touch the MCP server or
  permission hooks, so a broken server/hook surface can no longer reach
  PyPI or move the marketplace ref by accident
  ([GH-387](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/387))
- **Sharpen the permission doctor across worktrees** — the doctor now
  surfaces horizontal duplicates when multiple MCP servers expose the
  same capability under different prefixes, and anchors each project's
  `.worktrees` parent across every CWD-keyed permission scope, so
  cross-worktree work no longer drifts out of coverage
  ([GH-371](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/371),
  [GH-376](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/376))
- **Self-review a green PR before pinging a teammate** —
  `Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review` lets a supervisor eyeball the PR
  themselves and defer the review request cleanly, with the DoD runner
  picking up the gh-pr checks and a standby Write permission so the
  flow runs without friction
  ([GH-396](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/396))
- **Run fanout swarms straight through to merged PRs** — each
  `Dev10x:work-on` child in a worktree-isolated swarm no longer stalls
  after branch or PR creation, so the orchestrator carries every item
  to completion without manual nudging
  ([GH-368](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/368))
- **Read plugin-maintenance preferences from the XDG config path** —
  `Dev10x:plugin-maintenance` now reads and writes
  `plugin-maintenance-prefs.yaml` under `~/.config/Dev10x/`, completing
  the XDG config-layout migration
  ([GH-390](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/390))
- **Name milestones without collisions across initiatives** —
  milestone naming gains initiative-prefixed conventions so parallel
  initiatives can create milestones without clashing
  ([GH-388](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/388))

### Fixes

- **Stop `permission clean` from silently removing covered rules** —
  cleanup no longer drops project-local rules that may not be covered
  by global rules, ending phantom permission prompts after a clean
  ([GH-391](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/391))
- **Restore `mass-rewrite.py` to its un-mangled form** — a bulk-rewrite
  workaround had corrupted the file's glyphs, docstring, and print
  strings; it is restored to its last-good commit so git-groom
  mass-rewrite works correctly
  ([GH-415](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/415))

## 0.76.0 — Friction-Free CLI, Typed MCP Boundaries & Smarter PR Review

Released 2026-05-31

### Features

- **Pre-approve the safe inspection surface so unattended runs stop
  stalling** — narrow allow-rules for read-only tools, `--version`
  flags, and read-only git/gh/uv subcommands let adaptive and AFK
  sessions run without tripping the permission gate or the "don't ask
  again" catch-all footgun
  ([GH-310](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/310))
- **Run structured-data tools without a prompt** — 15 read-only
  processors and validators (`jq`, `yamllint`, `actionlint`, `shellcheck`,
  binary-existence lookups, and more) join the base permission catalog,
  so the canonical structural alternatives `Dev10x:diag-friction` steers
  toward no longer prompt themselves
  ([GH-308](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/308))
- **Pre-approve docs, extracted probes, Railway, and safe git flags** —
  four permission-catalog follow-ups land together: ~30 canonical HTTPS
  doc domains for WebFetch, execution of extracted `/tmp/Dev10x` and
  `~/.claude/tools` probes, a Railway read-only tier-3 group, and a
  `flag_overrides` schema that ships `git clean -n`, `git branch -d`,
  and `git reset --dry-run`
  ([GH-369](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/369),
  [GH-370](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/370),
  [GH-372](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/372),
  [GH-373](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/373))
- **Stop quoted shell metacharacters from triggering false blocks** — a
  quote-aware tokenizer strips single-quoted spans, ANSI-C strings, and
  escaped pairs before threat detection, and the new `DX012`
  safe-expansion validator approves commands whose metacharacters resolve
  to known-safe env vars, so `gh api graphql -f query='{...}'` and
  `echo "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"` pass cleanly
  ([GH-309](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/309))
- **Block MCP tool names pasted as shell commands** — the new `DX013`
  validator hard-blocks a command whose first token matches
  `mcp__<server>__<tool>` and steers back to the tool-call protocol,
  closing a recurring failure mode that memory and docs alone could not
  prevent
  ([GH-375](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/375))
- **Steer in-place stream editors to the Write/Edit tool** — flag-aware
  detection routes `sed -i`, `perl -i`, `gawk -i inplace`, and
  `dd of=<file>` to the editing tools while leaving read-only `sed -n`
  and `awk` forms untouched
  ([GH-374](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/374))
- **Request JIRA and Slack reviews without env-prefix friction** — the
  `dev10x:jira` base skill becomes the plugin-bundled `Dev10x:jira` with
  a documented tenant-wrapper pattern, and `Dev10x:slack-review-request`
  gains a real `dev10x skill notify` CLI surface, so neither tenant
  wrappers nor Slack steps fall back to version-pinned script paths
  ([GH-233](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/233),
  [GH-313](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/313))
- **Edit PR inline review-thread comments via MCP** — the new
  `pr_review_comment_edit` wrapper covers the `pulls/comments` endpoint
  that `issue_comment_edit` could not reach, so clearing a stale bot
  finding to unblock the merge gate no longer needs raw `gh api PATCH`
  ([GH-304](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/304))
- **Push small fixes directly during PR review** — `Dev10x:gh-pr-review`
  adds a courtesy-fixup path that classifies mechanical findings
  (unused imports, trivial renames, dead code) and offers a batch scope
  gate before pushing, ending the comment-then-author round-trip
  ([GH-323](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/323))
- **Leave a PR review as a GitHub draft** — a draft-vs-submit gate in
  `Dev10x:gh-pr-review` lets reviewers finalize on the Files-changed tab
  before the review becomes visible, with intent-detection defaults and
  author-aware biasing
  ([GH-319](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/319))
- **Use comment reactions as a triage signal** — `Dev10x:gh-pr-triage`
  reads a comment's reactions as a verdict lean when no directing prose
  exists, and `Dev10x:gh-pr-respond` surfaces a `Signal` column so
  reaction-only verdicts stay auditable before the batch approval gate
  ([GH-314](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/314))
- **Catch a stale CLI before running maintenance** — `Dev10x:plugin-maintenance`
  now reads the marketplace manifest and installed versions in a
  preflight step, prompts to update when either surface is behind, and
  can persist the choice so future sessions skip the prompt
  ([GH-307](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/307))
- **Surface parked work from the canonical session store** —
  `Dev10x:park-discover` now reads `session.yaml` as its primary
  substrate, every park writer indexes into that store, and its
  documented commands route through Read/Grep/MCP wrappers instead of
  friction-triggering `cat`/`grep -rn`/subshell forms
  ([GH-85](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/85))
- **Run the MCP servers over HTTP without code changes** — a
  `DEV10X_MCP_TRANSPORT` env var selects the transport, making the
  daemon/HTTP path opt-in while STDIO stays the default
  ([GH-335](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/335))
- **Normalize PyCharm/uv worktrees after checkout** — the new
  `Dev10x:ide-normalize` skill fixes `.idea/` module names, disables the
  `ADD_CONTENT_ROOTS` setting that breaks editable installs, backfills the
  Django settings module, and patches the uv-SDK FLAVOR_DATA gap that
  crashed PyCharm on fresh worktrees
  ([GH-320](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/320))

### Hardening

- **Block privilege-escalation commands by default** — `sudo`, `doas`,
  `pkexec`, and `sudoedit` deny rules ship in the base catalog for any
  command shape, with a narrow `sudo-apt` opt-in group for routine
  package management, closing the root-level bypass an agent reached for
  in the wild
  ([GH-326](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/326))

### Fixes

- **Restore the `pr_get` and `resolve_review_thread` MCP tools** — both
  wrappers failed and forced raw `gh` fallbacks; `pr_get` no longer
  requests the invalid `merged` field (deriving merged-ness from state),
  `resolve_review_thread` queries the correct `reviewThreads` shape, and
  `request-review` routes detection through the stable `pr_detect` wrapper
  ([GH-329](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/329))
- **Convert a PR review to draft only when inline comments exist** — the
  CI review step queries the real `reviewComments` count instead of
  trusting the model's recollection, ending spurious draft conversions
  that blocked merge with zero findings
  ([GH-333](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/333))
- **Stop the permission generalizer from emitting invalid rules** — two
  classes of bug produced mid-string `:*` forms that Claude Code rejects
  after running maintenance on 0.75.0; the generalizer pattern and two
  redundant `grep` rules are fixed, with a regression test for the
  quoted-JSON-blob arg case
  ([GH-315](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/315))
- **Unblock the pre-PR gate on every branch** — the doctor passes
  `str(cwd)` to `subprocess_utils.run`, resolving a mypy type mismatch
  that the GH-245 cwd-discipline merge introduced on develop
  ([GH-245](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/245))

### Refactors

- **Enforce a uniform `Result[T]` contract at the MCP boundary** — the
  polymorphic `to_dict` branch is dropped, `record_upgrade` and `_gh_api`
  return `Result[dict]`, and the 1834-line `server_cli.py` splits into
  github/git/plan/audit/misc tool modules; ADR-0009 records the decision
  ([GH-243](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/243))
- **Seal context boundaries with domain protocols** — Milestone 5 of the
  architecture audit adds ADR-0007/0008, moves session policy rules and
  the audit writer behind protocols, extracts `SettingsDocument` for
  settings I/O, and re-homes the audit-skills permission analysis so the
  context boundary points the right way
  ([GH-244](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/244))
- **Make subprocess calls honor the caller's worktree** — a sync
  `subprocess_utils.run` chokepoint defaults `cwd` to the bound effective
  CWD, direct `subprocess.run`/`os.getcwd()`/module-scope `GitContext()`
  usages are routed through it, and a lint test forbids regressions
  ([GH-245](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/245))
- **Resolve contradictory allow-rule diagnostics** — a single canonical
  `AllowRule` value object with space-boundary-aware matching replaces
  four drifted matchers and several duplicated settings loaders, so a
  rule can no longer be reported matched by one diagnostic and unmatched
  by another
  ([GH-242](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/242))
- **Extract skill logic into importable, unit-tested modules** — the
  release classifier, JTBD extraction, Slack formatting, permission
  config loading, skill-index builder, and subagent-status/batch-detection
  protocols move into `dev10x.skills.*` modules with full coverage, the
  dead PR-status batch query API is retired, and the audit-skills boundary
  is sealed
  ([GH-246](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/246),
  [GH-248](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/248),
  [GH-244](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/244))
- **Replace dispatch chains with declarative patterns** — Milestone 10
  of the architecture audit applies map-based dispatch and the
  template-method pattern across hooks, validators, and the task state
  machine, retiring if/elif chains and per-call should_run/validate
  sequencing (11 of 36 findings; the rest deferred)
  ([GH-249](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/249))
- **Drop env-prefix friction from plugin-maintenance, JIRA, and
  aws-vault** — maintenance steps route uniformly through
  `uvx dev10x permission`, and the JIRA and aws-vault scripts accept a
  leading `--tenant`/`--registry` flag so callers never need the
  allow-rule-defeating `VAR=value script.sh` prefix
  ([GH-306](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/306),
  [GH-311](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/311))

### Tests

- **Cover the recently shipped MCP and CLI shipping paths** — handler
  tests land for PR/issue comment, review-request, and thread-resolution
  tools, plus playbook CLI and config-schema validation, closing the M8
  audit's zero-coverage gaps
  ([GH-247](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/247))
- **Stop plan_sync tests from polluting the repo root** — the two
  offending tests return a real `tmp_path`, and a session-scoped autouse
  guard removes and fails on stray `<MagicMock …>` files
  ([GH-332](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/332))

### Docs

- **Ratify the importable-module policy and script-vs-domain rules** —
  ADR-0010 records that skill logic lives in importable modules with
  thin uv-script shims, a new boundaries rule sets the print-vs-logging
  and `sys.exit`-vs-`Result` conventions, and `ci_check_status` emits its
  error JSON on stdout so stdout-parsing consumers never see empty output
  ([GH-246](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/246))
- **Record the `dev10x` CLI invocation benchmark and decision** —
  ADR-0012 captures the startup comparison of `dev10x`, `uvx dev10x`, and
  the in-process call, leading with `dev10x …` as the preferred form and
  keeping `uvx dev10x …` as the zero-install fallback
- **Document validator, permission, and orchestration test patterns** —
  new reference docs capture safe-flag overrides, multi-flag validator
  detection, validator test structure, permission tier-assignment logic,
  and regression/schema testing for orchestration paths, distilled from
  lessons-learned analysis
  ([GH-271](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/271))

## 0.75.0 — Friction Reduction, Typed Boundaries & Business-ROI JTBD

Released 2026-05-27

### Features

- **Anchor JTBD Job Stories in business ROI** — the `Dev10x:jtbd`
  skill now traces refactor, infrastructure, and dependency-bump
  work up to the end-customer outcome instead of accepting "the
  developer wants to" as the actor, so every PR body, ticket scope,
  and release note inherits business-meaningful framing. A new
  doctrine memo grounds the rule with worked examples and citations
  ([GH-276](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/276))
- **Eliminate per-version permission churn via the `uvx dev10x`
  CLI** — plugin-maintenance work routes through the version-stable
  CLI so a single set of allow-rules survives every plugin upgrade,
  retiring four cache-path shim scripts that went stale on each
  version bump
  ([GH-269](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/269))
- **Allow trimmer pipelines without broadening allow-rules** — the
  new `PipelineAllowValidator` (DX011) auto-approves `| tail`,
  `| head`, and `| wc` pipelines when every segment already matches
  an existing Bash allow-rule, removing a recurring source of one-off
  approval prompts
  ([GH-262](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/262))
- **Edit and delete PR/issue comments via MCP** — `issue_comment_edit`
  and `issue_comment_delete` wrappers replace raw `gh api PATCH/DELETE`
  calls, so the "edit a stale bot finding to clear the merge gate"
  workflow no longer triggers an approval prompt
  ([GH-283](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/283))
- **Recommend structured tools in `diag-friction`** — blocked
  inline-code commands now map to canonical tools (yq, jq, yamllint,
  actionlint, curl) from a bundled knowledge base instead of always
  suggesting a `~/.claude/tools/` extraction
  ([GH-282](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/282))
- **Land fixups on the commits that own their lines** — `Dev10x:git-fixup`
  blames each staged hunk against the branch range to target the owning
  commit, ending the autosquash conflict loops that rerere memoized
  ([GH-299](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/299))
- **Enable scope-aware triage and priority-split responses** — a YAGNI
  verdict in `gh-pr-triage` plus a now/fast-follow priority axis in
  `gh-pr-respond` let reviewers route out-of-scope findings and defer
  non-urgent VALIDs without manual steering
  ([GH-297](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/297))
- **Prevent silent feature activation via reused relations** — PR
  review gains a cross-consumer behavioural-reuse check that flags when
  populating an existing relation could activate a feature gated on row
  presence in a sibling repo
  ([GH-290](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/290))
- **Prevent context-anxiety pauses in adaptive solo sessions** — a
  SessionStart reassurance block fires under adaptive friction with a
  solo maintainer so the agent trusts long task lists instead of
  re-asking settled scope decisions
  ([GH-261](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/261))
- **Expose the Dev10x config root via bare CLI invocation and finish
  the XDG migration** — bare `dev10x` echoes the resolved config root
  for portable shell idioms, and the last three user configs migrate
  off `~/.claude/` so fresh projects no longer hit the sensitive-path
  consent gate
  ([GH-270](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/270))
- **Ship AWS Secrets Manager access as a plugin-bundled skill** —
  `Dev10x:aws-vault` relocates the secrets/kubectl wrappers out of
  user space with a configurable service registry so the skill is
  shareable across projects

### Fixes

- **Stabilize the permission doctor on wheel installs** — the baseline
  permissions catalog now ships inside the package and resolves via a
  module-relative path, fixing the `FileNotFoundError` crash on
  PyPI-installed dev10x
  ([GH-264](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/264))

### Hardening

- **Enforce atomic writes and locks on boundary hot paths** — session
  state, plan context, the platform registry, and the audit log now use
  atomic writes and file locks so concurrent worktrees, parallel hooks,
  and the long-lived MCP server cannot lose state in a race; ADR-0011
  documents the layered atomicity model
  ([GH-240](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/240))

### Refactors

- **Enforce typed identifiers across plan and PR surfaces** — five new
  value objects (Task, TicketId, SkillName, RepositoryRef, BranchName)
  replace dict-of-Any threading and scattered regex literals, validating
  inputs once at each boundary
  ([GH-241](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/241))
- **Ship flaky-test fixes through the `work-on` pipeline** —
  `Dev10x:py-test-flaky` is now a thin investigator and ticket scoper
  that hands delivery to `Dev10x:work-on`, so flaky fixes inherit the
  same gates, self-review, and PR monitoring as any other ticket
  ([GH-281](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/281))
- **Strip forbidden-token priming from skill docs** — skill bodies no
  longer name `DEV10X_SKIP_CMD_VALIDATION` as a negative example, and a
  doctor strategy scans for the priming token outside the hook layer
  ([GH-272](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/272))

### Docs

- **Anchor config paths in cross-platform notation** — skill docs use
  abstract `<Dev10x config>/<file>` paths backed by a platform
  resolution table instead of literal `~/.config/Dev10x/` forms that
  misled Windows users
  ([GH-270](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/270))
- **Ensure the no-checkpoints rule travels with auto-advance** — a
  canonical "no checkpoints" definition plus per-skill reinforcement
  stops adaptive-friction sessions from inserting "Ready to proceed?"
  pauses mid-pipeline
  ([GH-223](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/223))
- **Route fixup comment fetch through MCP wrappers** — `Dev10x:git-fixup`
  Step 2 documents `pr_detect` and `pr_comments` instead of the raw `gh`
  shapes the friction scanner forbids
  ([GH-299](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/299))
- **Document review and testing patterns from superseded bot PRs** —
  add the backlog-deferral format, pytest fixture/async handler
  patterns, the hook refactor + lazy-import checklist, and the
  instructions.md allowed-tools scope clarification
  ([GH-202](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/202),
  [GH-124](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/124),
  [GH-130](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/130),
  [GH-104](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/104))

## 0.74.0 — MCP Routing Coverage & Session Mode Awareness

Released 2026-05-21

### Features

- **Route pytest through the `run_tests` MCP wrapper** — `Dev10x:py-test`
  now drives test execution through the MCP tool so coverage gates,
  output capture, and skill enforcement stay consistent across
  invocations
  ([GH-238](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/238))
- **Route `gh pr view` and issue state changes through MCP wrappers** —
  `pr_get`, `issue_close`, and `issue_reopen` replace raw `gh` calls,
  closing the last common CLI fallbacks the routing hook saw in the
  wild
  ([GH-267](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/267))
- **Route `ticket-scope` comments through the `issue_comment` MCP tool**
  — scoping comments land via the structured wrapper instead of `gh
  issue comment`
  ([GH-228](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/228))
- **Surface session mode and classify interrupts** — sessions now
  expose their active mode (attended, walk-away, etc.) and classify
  interrupts so skills can adapt their gating behavior
  ([GH-189](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/189),
  [GH-229](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/229))
- **Pre-format Python files before staging in `git-commit`** —
  ruff/black run automatically on staged Python changes so commits
  never carry unformatted code
  ([GH-224](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/224))

### Fixes

- **Restore `Dev10x:py-test` after a hook hard-block regression** —
  the validation hook no longer hard-blocks the documented `uv run
  pytest` invocation that `Dev10x:py-test` retries
  ([GH-274](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/274))

### Refactors

- **Codify skill-name suffix convention and apply the rename map** —
  skill directory and invocation names now follow a consistent suffix
  convention; the rename map keeps backward references working
  ([GH-217](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/217))
- **Trim `diag-friction` and `gh-pr-review` SKILL.md bodies** — both
  skill bodies were extracted to references so per-invocation token
  cost drops without losing detail
  ([GH-197](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/197),
  [GH-199](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/199))

## 0.73.0 — XDG Config, MCP Wrapper Coverage & Walk-Away Mode

Released 2026-05-19

### Features

- **Move Dev10x userspace config out of `~/.claude/`** — config now
  lives under the OS-standard XDG path (`~/.config/Dev10x/` on
  Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%/Dev10x/` on Windows; override via
  `DEV10X_CONFIG_HOME`). Legacy files at `~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/`
  and `~/.claude/Dev10x/` are migrated lazily on first read and
  explicitly by `dev10x config migrate` (wired into both
  `Dev10x:upgrade-cleanup` Step 1 and `Dev10x:doctor` Step 0)
  ([GH-215](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/215))
- **Enable spec-as-source-of-truth pipeline (SPDD)** — M1 milestone
  lands the spec-driven development flow so tickets, code, and
  acceptance criteria stay aligned from a single source
- **Close GitHub CLI wrapper gap with 4 new MCP tools** —
  `milestone_create`, `issue_edit`, `issue_comment`, and
  `issue_list` replace raw `gh api`/`gh issue` invocations so
  the routing hook can steer agents away from CLI fallbacks
  ([GH-220](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/220))
- **Route `project-scope` through bulk MCP wrappers** — milestone
  and issue creation use the bulk tools, eliminating per-item
  approval friction for multi-ticket projects
  ([GH-222](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/222))
- **Route `gh pr edit` to the `update_pr` MCP wrapper** — drops
  another raw-CLI path and keeps PR edits behind the structured
  wrapper
  ([GH-209](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/209))
- **Enable `gh-pr-merge` Step 5 via the `merge_pr` MCP tool** —
  final merge step runs through the wrapper so guardrails stay
  consistent end-to-end
  ([GH-232](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/232))
- **Enable walk-away mode for unattended sessions** — supervisor
  can hand off long-running flows so the user does not need to
  baby-sit each prompt
  ([GH-231](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/231))
- **Defer skill-audit invocations via `Dev10x:skill-audit-queue`** —
  audits run asynchronously instead of blocking the active session
  ([GH-219](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/219))
- **Detect Slack-forwarded threads in `ticket-scope` Phase 1.2** —
  forwarded threads carry their original context so scoping reads
  the right conversation
  ([GH-218](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/218))
- **Enable sibling pub/sub coordination via a JSONL bus** —
  parallel sub-agents exchange progress and findings on a shared
  JSONL channel
  ([GH-133](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/133))
- **Surface `push_safe` results so callers can confirm pushes** —
  the wrapper now returns `{pushed, ref, remote, sha, tracking,
  ci_run_url}` instead of `{}` on success, removing the
  silent-success ambiguity
  ([GH-188](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/188))
- **Surface permission-friction diagnosis as `diag-friction`** —
  refactored diagnosis is now a first-class command/skill
  ([GH-214](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/214))
- **Advise on redundant content fetches in PreToolUse** — agents
  get steered away from re-reading content the session already
  loaded
  ([GH-206](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/206))
- **Steer agents to serialized commands over shell loops** —
  guidance hook nudges toward separate tool calls instead of
  `for`/`while` bash loops that defeat permission matching
  ([GH-234](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/234))
- **Audit every validation bypass via a rationale string** — the
  skip path now requires a justification recorded in the audit
  log
  ([GH-226](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/226))

### Fixes

- **Stabilize skill self-checks and permission rules**
  ([GH-252](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/252))
- **Stop Gate 6 from silently skipping after resolve** —
  `gh-pr-respond` now re-validates instead of treating a
  resolved thread as fully addressed
  ([GH-208](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/208))
- **Stop false-positive blocks on `find -name 'git-push-safe.sh'`** —
  the validator no longer mistakes the literal pattern for a
  push command
  ([GH-210](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/210))

### Docs & Internals

- Record 2026-05-18 architecture audit findings under `docs/memos/`
- Document Example 5 in the diag-friction examples list
- Restore ruff format on doctor and permission modules

## 0.72.0 — Doctor, Fanout Swarm & Permission Hygiene

Released 2026-05-17

### Features

- **Diagnose systemic drift with `Dev10x:doctor`** — new skill
  surfaces plugin-version mismatches, missing per-project skill
  pre-approvals, and clusters session paths to propose coherent
  directory coverage so permission friction is fixed at the root
  ([GH-87](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/87),
  [GH-116](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/116),
  [GH-115](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/115))
- **Prompt for upgrade-cleanup when plugin version drifts** —
  SessionStart detects an installed version newer than the
  recorded baseline and nudges the user toward
  `Dev10x:upgrade-cleanup`
  ([GH-109](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/109))
- **Enable native-Agent fanout swarm dispatch** — `Dev10x:fanout`
  now dispatches independent work items as parallel sub-agents
  with a 6-phase execution model, conflict-wave management, and
  recursive-fanout guard
  ([GH-36](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/36))
- **Invert monitor architecture to supervisor + micro-agents** —
  `gh-pr-monitor` runs a long-lived supervisor that dispatches
  read-only micro-agents per check, constrained by contract so
  background monitors cannot mutate the repo
  ([GH-68](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/68))
- **Enable solo-maintainer milestone-bundle PR shipping** —
  `work-on` and `gh-pr-create` understand parent tracker tickets
  and bundle overlapping sub-tickets into a single PR with a
  scoped review auto-skip
  ([GH-185](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/185),
  [GH-196](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/196),
  [GH-161](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/161))
- **Adopt subagent status protocol across orchestration** —
  orchestrators read explicit `DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS /
  NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED` status from dispatched agents
  ([GH-69](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/69))
- **Pre-approve Linear MCP tools in plugin baseline** — drops
  per-session approval prompts for Linear issue, comment, and
  document operations
  ([GH-204](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/204))
- **Enable top-level PR issue-comment replies via MCP** — new
  `pr_issue_comment` tool replaces raw `gh api POST` fallbacks
  ([GH-205](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/205))
- **Enable multi-workspace Slack posting** — Slack skills route
  per-workspace credentials so multiple orgs can be addressed
  from one session
  ([GH-98](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/98))
- **Enforce push-then-create order in `gh-pr-create`** — branch
  is pushed before `gh pr create` runs, eliminating empty-PR
  failures
  ([GH-159](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/159))
- **Default `gh-pr-merge` to rebase for curated history** —
  matches the project's atomic-commit convention
  ([GH-134](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/134))
- **Enforce one-fixup-per-comment via mechanical guardrail** —
  prevents bundled fixup commits that obscure review traceability
  ([GH-123](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/123))
- **Detect branch drift before commits land off-target** —
  pre-commit gate catches mistargeted feature work
  ([GH-147](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/147))
- **Enrich audit issues with bundling labels** — skill-audit
  output groups related findings for batched remediation
  ([GH-190](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/190))
- **Enable early-insight short-circuit in `skill-audit`** —
  surfaces high-confidence findings before all phases complete
  ([GH-113](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/113))
- **Enable bundled-fixup replies and post-groom SHA refresh** —
  PR comment replies follow rebase-rewritten history
  ([GH-86](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/86))
- **Compare user playbooks against plugin defaults** — surfaces
  stale overrides after plugin upgrades
  ([GH-192](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/192))
- **Cover monorepo `uv run --project` invocations with one rule**
  — single allow rule eliminates per-subdir approval prompts
  ([GH-137](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/137))
- **Nudge agents away from prefix-bypassing shell shapes** — new
  hook validator flags `cd && cmd` and env-prefix patterns that
  defeat allow-rule prefix matching
  ([GH-119](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/119))
- **Enable hook-block routing for bare `pytest` invocations** —
  redirects to the `py-test` skill so coverage gating runs
  ([GH-155](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/155))
- **Enable self-healing permission hints** — `skill-reinforcement`
  proposes the missing allow rule alongside the skill redirect
  ([GH-178](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/178))
- **Enforce pre-staging gate in `git-commit` Step 10** — refuses
  to commit when nothing is staged, avoiding empty commits
  ([GH-157](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/157))
- **Enforce Phase 3 plan-approval `AskUserQuestion` always** —
  `work-on` cannot skip the plan-approval gate
  ([GH-158](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/158))
- **Track `skill-audit` invocation as cycle-audit task** —
  audit runs surface as first-class work items
  ([GH-148](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/148))

### Refactors

- **Group domain by archetype into 4 sub-packages** — domain
  layer reorganized along Software Archetypes for clarity
  ([GH-145](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/145))
- **Unify MCP boundary error envelope via `Result[T]`** —
  internal functions return typed `SuccessResult`/`ErrorResult`;
  MCP handlers unwrap at the boundary
  ([GH-108](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/108))
- **Decompose `hooks/session.py` into archetype-aligned modules**
  ([GH-144](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/144))
- **Consolidate Plan domain via service layer + `TaskStatus`** —
  Plan operations route through a service layer with a typed
  status enum
  ([GH-81](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/81))
- **Promote validator registry and capability dispatch** —
  validators register declaratively
  ([GH-82](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/82))
- **Split platform `Registry` and add Tell-Don't-Ask helpers** —
  permission diagnostics and investigator facades promoted to
  public surface
  ([GH-83](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/83))
- **Type hook phase/outcome via `HookPhase` + `HookOutcome`** —
  replace `friction_level` strings with `FrictionLevel` enum,
  `PROFILE_HIERARCHY` tuple with `ProfileTier` enum, and
  centralize Claude Code filesystem paths via `ClaudeDir`
  ([GH-80](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/80))
- **Promote permission helpers to public, drop stdout-capture
  hack** — permission helpers no longer rely on captured stdout
  ([GH-92](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/92))
- **Unify validator error returns with `Result[str]`** — single
  return shape across all validators
  ([GH-78](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/78))
- **Run permission-audit analysis in-process** — eliminates
  subprocess fan-out for audit phases
  ([GH-142](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/142))
- **Consolidate audit log reading into `audit/log_reader`** —
  one reader serves CLI, MCP, and the audit skill
  ([GH-143](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/143))
- **Centralize PR status fetches behind `PRStatusQuery`** —
  removes scattered `gh pr view` calls
  ([GH-146](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/146))

### Fixes

- **Authenticate GitHub App via Bearer scheme** — JWT requests
  now use the correct header
  ([GH-76](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/76))
- **Stabilize subprocess error contract for missing scripts** —
  consistent error shape when scripts are absent
  ([GH-89](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/89))
- **Exclude bot approvals from review-state precheck** — bot
  approvals no longer satisfy human-review gating
  ([GH-128](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/128))
- **Stop blocking `mktmp.sh` args as git commit** — hook
  validator no longer misreads helper invocations
  ([GH-84](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/84))
- **Surface git-repo errors from `plan.json_summary`** —
  callers see the underlying repo error instead of an empty
  payload
  ([GH-78](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/78))

### Security

- **Prevent state file corruption under concurrent writers** —
  state writes use atomic file replacement
  ([GH-77](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/77))
- **Enforce cwd binding on MCP handlers via `@requires_cwd`** —
  handlers cannot operate outside the bound working directory
  ([GH-78](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/78))
- **Constrain background monitor agents to read-only by
  contract** — dispatched monitor sub-agents cannot mutate state
  ([GH-68](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/68))
- **Enforce `gh-pr-merge` skill via raw CLI deny** — raw
  `gh pr merge` is blocked to keep pre-merge gates in play
  ([GH-112](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/112))
- **Allow `uv run dev10x` from plugin-maintenance** — scoped
  allow rule so maintenance can self-invoke
  ([GH-99](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/99))
- **Allow read-only `find` over plugin cache** — narrow rule
  for cache hygiene checks
  ([GH-122](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/122))
- **Enable grep across plugin cache + memory without prompts** —
  removes friction for retrospective queries
  ([GH-135](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/135))

### Docs

- **Keep internal GitHub MCP over official server** — ADR-0006
  documents why Dev10x ships composite GitHub tools rather than
  depending on `github/github-mcp-server`
- **Lift `Verify AC` invariant to a universal Dev10x rule** —
  every skill ends with a Verify-AC terminal task
  ([GH-149](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/149))
- **Close skill-bypass gaps in `work-on` shipping pipeline** —
  documents mandatory skill chain through commit and PR
  ([GH-152](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/152))
- **Mandate `gh-pr-monitor` invocation after PR creation** —
  removes the "and then what?" gap
  ([GH-162](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/162))
- **Close 7 permission/hook gaps across scaffolding and skills**
  ([GH-127](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/127))
- **Plan SPDD REASONS Canvas adoption across scope skills**
  ([GH-70](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/70))
- **Document `Result[T]` envelope in `mcp-tools.md`**
  ([GH-93](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/93))

### Internal

- **Raise test coverage on critical MCP and CLI paths**
  ([GH-79](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/79))
- **Rebaseline `mcp_server_import` startup gate** — startup-time
  budget updated after import refactors
  ([GH-121](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/121))

## 0.71.0 — GitHub App Verification & Acknowledgments

Released 2026-05-08

### Features

- **Prove github-app setup credentials end-to-end** — setup flow
  prompts for install scope (Personal/Org/Manual), accepts a
  `.pem` file path (defaulting to the newest key in `~/Downloads`)
  and stores it under `~/.claude/Dev10x/github-bot/` with chmod
  600, then verifies the App JWT against `GET /app`,
  `GET /app/installations`, and a per-installation token+repo
  read before writing config — failed verification exits without
  saving ([GH-72](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/72))

### Refactors

- **Discourage agents from misusing skip-validation flag** —
  rewrite the skill-redirect block-message hint as a ⚠️ warning
  that names the lazy-bypass pattern and reserves
  `DEV10X_SKIP_CMD_VALIDATION=true` for skill authors, so agents
  stop copy-pasting it as a shortcut around recommended skills

### Docs

- **Acknowledge external contributors and inspirations** — add
  `ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md` crediting @tiretutor-paul as project
  godfather alongside external bug reporters, and list the
  projects, talks, and writing that shaped Dev10x's design
  (QRSPI / HumanLayer, obra/superpowers, Fowler PoEAA,
  Refactoring Guru, Software Archetypes, gitmoji,
  semantic-release, JTBD community)

### Internal

- **Apply ruff format to permission-related files** — bring six
  pre-existing files under `src/dev10x/skills/permission*` and
  matching tests in line with project style after pre-PR checks
  flagged them on develop

## 0.70.0 — Subagent Protocols & Privacy Hardening

Released 2026-05-05

### Features

- **Enable subagent status protocol parsing** — orchestrators
  read explicit `DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / NEEDS_CONTEXT /
  BLOCKED` final-status lines from dispatched agents instead of
  guessing from free-form prose, and `gh-pr-monitor`'s GH-901
  fallback parses `BLOCKED:` as the primary signal
  ([GH-69](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/69))
- **Enable bot identity for agent-generated PR replies** — opt-in
  GitHub App identity routes review-thread replies and PR summary
  comments through `dev10x-bot[bot]` while keeping PR creation,
  reviewer assignment, and thread resolution under the engineer's
  account ([GH-65](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/65))
- **Enable in-place PR body updates via MCP tool** — new
  `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__update_pr` lets `gh-pr-create` update
  mode and `git-groom` Phase 4 refresh PR body, title, or base
  branch without raw `gh api PATCH` permission prompts
  ([GH-60](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/60))
- **Stabilize fixup! reply links across grooming** — fixup reply
  comments use absolute `/commit/HASH` permalinks so links keep
  resolving after rebase rewrites SHAs
  ([GH-52](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/52))
- **Detect privacy and external service drift in CI** — a new
  privacy-audit workflow scans source for external services and
  outbound network usage, cross-checks against `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`,
  and comments on PRs that introduce undocumented integrations
  ([GH-6](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/6))

### Fixes

- **Allow MCP tools to target session worktree** — MCP tools that
  shell out to `git`/`gh` honor a per-call `cwd` so EnterWorktree
  sessions stop hitting the spawning repo's branch and dirty-tree
  state ([GH-979](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/979))
- **Cover user-global `settings.json` in upgrade-cleanup
  rewrites** — `update-paths.py` now discovers both
  `~/.claude/settings.json` and `settings.local.json` when
  `include_user_settings: true`, so versioned plugin paths no
  longer go stale after every upgrade
  ([GH-982](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/982))

### Security

- **Scrub private context from skill-audit upstream reports** —
  audit-report and skill-audit Phase 7 redact private repo
  names, branches, tracker IDs, paths, and free-text excerpts
  before filing upstream issues, with `AskUserQuestion` gating
  unscrubbable findings ([GH-56](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/56))

### Refactors

- **Reduce agent dispatch tokens via body extraction** — apply
  the skill-body-extraction strategy to plugin-distributed
  agents; `permission-auditor.md` shrinks from 226 → 159 lines
  with bulk content moved under
  `references/agents/permission-auditor/`
  ([GH-983](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/983))
- **Defer pre-PR checks to project pre-commit settings** —
  `pre-pr-checks.sh` delegates to `pre-commit run` when
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is present so projects own their
  ruff/mypy versions and excludes end-to-end
  ([GH-38](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/38))
- **Allow direct-to-base commits in solo-maintainer mode** —
  `git-commit` reads `solo_maintainer` from session config and
  skips the develop/main/master block so single-author repos
  can commit directly to the base branch
  ([GH-57](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/57))

### Docs

- **Inject friction context into skill-audit Wave 2** — Phase 3
  compliance subagent receives `friction_level` and
  `active_modes` so documented auto-select gates score as
  COMPLIANT instead of SKIPPED_STEP
  ([GH-55](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/55))
- **Tighten `ticket-scope` research tool routing** — Phase 2
  mandates Grep/Read tools over bash `grep`/`cat` and Phase 7.1
  routes through the `mktmp` MCP tool
  ([GH-55](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/55))
- **Strengthen `work-on` Phase 1 + Phase 2 enforcement** — route
  workspace detection through `gh-context`, inline the TaskList
  self-check, mark subtask creation REQUIRED before any Agent
  dispatch, and prohibit Explore-subagent dispatch for source
  fetch ([GH-55](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/55))
- **Repoint changelog GH refs to the right repo** — convert
  footnote-style refs to inline links and pin pre-0.67 entries
  plus 0.68 high-number refs to the archived
  `Dev10x-Claude2` repo so historical links keep resolving
  ([GH-53](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/53))

## 0.69.0 — Permission Friction & Audit Empiricism

Released 2026-05-01

### Features

- **Enable empirical investigation of permission rule shapes** —
  audit tooling captures real-world permission rule patterns so
  prefix-friction diagnostics rest on observed behavior instead
  of assumptions ([GH-47](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/47))
- **Emit per-skill Read rules with `~/` + `/home` twins** —
  `plugin-maintenance` writes both expansions so Read rules match
  regardless of which form Claude resolves at allow-check time
  ([GH-48](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/48))
- **Detect Write-overwrite, workspace, and exit-code friction in
  audit** — three new diagnostics surface common permission
  prompt causes that previously slipped past audit reports
  ([GH-46](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/46))
- **Prefer working-dir scripts when CWD is plugin source** —
  hooks and skills resolve script paths to the active checkout
  rather than the installed plugin, so local edits take effect
  immediately ([GH-42](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/42))
- **Register `/tmp/Dev10x` workspace via `plugin-maintenance`
  bootstrap** — first-run setup adds the workspace allow rule so
  `mktmp` and friends stop prompting on fresh installs ([GH-40](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/40))
- **Stop pre-creating files in `mktmp` to avoid Write-overwrite
  prompt** — the MCP tool returns a fresh path without touching
  it, so the first Write call no longer trips the overwrite gate
  ([GH-39](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/39))
- **Expose audit-wrap log discovery via MCP tools** —
  `audit_hook_log_path` and `audit_hook_recent` let skills query
  hook timing data without shelling out ([GH-29](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/29))
- **Add PoC option to `ticket-scope` approval gate** — scoping a
  proof-of-concept ticket no longer forces the full template
  treatment ([GH-33](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/33))
- **Auto-detect Slack state to skip redundant prompts** —
  `slack-review-request` checks for an existing token before
  prompting, smoothing the request-review flow ([GH-19](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/19))

### Fixes

- **Fix Server Tests workflow path** — the CI path filter now
  matches the relocated MCP server module ([GH-9](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/9))
- **Use REST API for PR body updates to avoid Projects-classic
  exit 1** — `gh-pr-create` update mode bypasses a `gh` GraphQL
  failure on repos still attached to classic projects ([GH-41](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/41))
- **Resolve pre-existing mypy errors in MCP github and hook
  audit** — strict typing passes again after the GitHub-domain
  lift
- **Scope pre-PR mypy invocation to `src/`** — match
  `pyproject.toml` so the pre-PR check stops scanning unrelated
  trees

### Refactors

- **Lift the GitHub domain into a top-level package** — MCP
  GitHub helpers move out of the server-internal namespace so
  CLI tools and tests can share them ([GH-9](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/9))
- **Lift simple MCP domains into top-level packages** —
  cohesive single-purpose MCP modules become standalone packages
  for easier reuse ([GH-9](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/9))
- **Reuse subprocess utilities outside the MCP layer** — the
  shared subprocess helper graduates out of `mcp/` so audit and
  CLI consumers stop duplicating it ([GH-9](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/9))
- **Enforce template selection in `ticket-scope` Phase 5.1** —
  skill body blocks free-text drift through the template gate
  ([GH-28](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/28))
- **Enforce `jtbd` delegation in `ticket-scope` Phase 4b** —
  Job Story drafting routes through the dedicated skill
  ([GH-27](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/27))
- **Enforce `instructions.md` read at `ticket-scope` startup** —
  body content loads explicitly so phase logic is visible to the
  agent ([GH-26](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/26))
- **Preserve hook guardrails outside split-rebase docs** —
  `git-commit-split` references hook rules instead of redefining
  them ([GH-15](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/15))
- **Enable consistent coverage gates in skill scripts** — every
  skill script enforces the same coverage threshold ([GH-13](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/13))
- **Route raw `git` CLI in skill bodies through wrappers** —
  skills call the safe-rebase / safe-push wrappers instead of
  raw `git` so guardrails stay in force ([GH-14](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/14))

### Documentation

- **Document fanout-parallel hook propagation surprises** —
  parent hooks may not run inside fanout children; the rule lives
  next to the skill ([GH-32](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/32))
- **Document fanout-parallel cold-load budget floor** — children
  pay a fixed cold-load cost, so fanout below the floor is
  slower than serial ([GH-31](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/31))
- **Document `--bare` strips OAuth in fanout-parallel children**
  — bare clones lose token auth, breaking `gh` calls inside
  fanout children ([GH-30](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/30))
- **Clarify mode prompt overrides preserve skills delegation** —
  override examples no longer suggest dropping skill calls
  ([GH-45](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/45))
- **Forbid skill partial-read downgrade in `work-on`** — the
  skill always reads the full body to keep orchestration
  contracts intact ([GH-44](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/44))
- **Enforce `gh-pr-respond` for all PR review comments** —
  responding directly via `gh` bypasses validation gates
  ([GH-43](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/43))

### Polish

- **Modernize `Result` generics with PEP 695 syntax**
- **Wrap long literal strings in `src/dev10x` and tests**
- **Resolve `RuleEngine F821` in `edit_validator` hook**
- **Sort imports in `skill-audit` script entry points**
- **Remove dead test variables and rename ambiguous loop var**

## 0.68.0 — First-Run Setup & PR-Skill Hardening

Released 2026-04-29

### Features

- **Streamline first-run permission setup** — bootstrap walks new
  users through the minimum permission set so the plugin works
  without per-tool prompting on day one ([GH-1](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/1))
- **Detect raw CLI in skill docs to prevent MCP/Skill bypass** —
  reviewer surfaces `gh`/`git` shell-outs in skill bodies that
  should route through MCP tools or sibling skills ([GH-5](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/5))
- **Eliminate per-invocation permission prompts in 18 skills** —
  audit-driven sweep adds the missing `allowed-tools` entries so
  these skills run without approval friction ([GH-11](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/11))
- **Allow scoped `pr_comments` listings on heavily reviewed PRs**
  — pagination + filtering avoid response-size limits on PRs with
  hundreds of threads ([GH-997](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/997))
- **Enable batched comment hiding via single GraphQL mutation** —
  one round-trip hides many comments instead of N requests
  ([GH-987](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/987))
- **Enable bootstrap coverage for uv/yq/git/gh patterns** —
  bootstrap allow rules cover the toolchain seen across skills
  out of the box ([GH-20](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/20))

### Fixes

- **Halt PR creation when pre-PR checks fail** — `gh-pr-create`
  no longer pushes a draft PR when type-check or test gates
  failed ([GH-998](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/998))
- **Enforce ticket-create haiku dispatch and tracker fast-fail**
  — tracker mismatches surface immediately and ticket creation
  uses the right model tier ([GH-998](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/998))
- **Enforce slack-review-request prepare script use** — Slack
  notifications go through the prepared script so token handling
  stays consistent ([GH-998](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/998))
- **Allow numeric-string comment IDs on `pr_comment` reply** —
  reply tool accepts both forms returned by upstream APIs
  ([GH-995](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/995))

### Refactors

- **Eliminate raw `gh` CLI in PR-skill bodies** — PR skills route
  through MCP wrappers, fixing audit findings and removing the
  raw-CLI bypass ([GH-12](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/12))
- **Guard `request-review` against approved PR pings** — already-
  approved PRs no longer ping reviewers redundantly ([GH-993](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/993))

## 0.67.0 — Maintenance & Repository History Pruning

Released 2026-04-26

Maintenance release. No new features or behavior changes — the
plugin keeps its 0.66.0 surface area while the repository itself
gets a fresh start.

### Maintenance

- **Prune repository history** — the public repository was rewound
  to a minimal commit history. Past development history is no
  longer reachable from `main`/`develop`; existing checkouts will
  need a fresh clone.

## 0.66.0 — Skill Slimdown & Post-Upgrade Polish

Released 2026-04-20

### Features

- **Enable pytest flaky-test fix orchestration** —
  `Dev10x:py-test-flaky` orchestrates the full flaky-test
  workflow (reproduce, root-cause, fix, ticket, branch,
  commit, PR) and delegates to Dev10x sibling skills so
  fixes follow project conventions without per-step coaching
- **Streamline upgrade-cleanup post-upgrade flow** —
  `ensure_base` auto-expands stale MCP wildcards, a new
  `enumerate-mcp.py` wrapper runs by absolute path,
  worktree-absolute paths drop out of the merge filter, the
  `session-start-reload.py` allow rule is annotated, and
  `update-paths`/`clean` gain a `--summary` flag so the post-
  v0.65.0 upgrade pass no longer needs hand-holding ([GH-965](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/965))

### Refactors

- **Rename oversized SKILL.md files to instructions.md** —
  pure rename of 14 skill bodies (work-on, skill-audit,
  git-commit, gh-pr-monitor, gh-pr-respond, fanout, git-groom,
  qa-self, scope, git-commit-split, playbook, ticket-scope,
  gh-pr-merge, gh-pr-create) so `git log --follow` preserves
  history ahead of the frontmatter split ([GH-970](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/970))
- **Split skill frontmatter from body via instructions.md** —
  each oversized skill now ships a ~30–50 line SKILL.md (YAML
  frontmatter plus a pointer) with the body in `instructions.md`,
  so MOTD index and skill discovery costs drop and the body only
  loads once a skill is invoked ([GH-970](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/970))
- **Split task-orchestration.md into per-pattern files** —
  the 649-line shared reference shrinks to a 50-line index
  that links to per-pattern files under `references/orchestration/`,
  so downstream consumers keep working without edits and
  pattern detail loads only when a skill links the specific
  file ([GH-970](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/970))

### Documentation

- **Clarify data-handling practices for adopters** — the
  plugin documentation now describes local-only storage paths,
  states that no telemetry or user data leaves the machine,
  enumerates third-party integrations with credential scopes,
  and provides data deletion commands plus the audit-log
  disable switch, closing the disclosure gap flagged by an
  external security audit ([GH-966](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/966))
- **Enable reliable plugin install via shell CLI** — install
  instructions now prefer `claude plugin marketplace add` and
  `claude plugin install` shell commands (run outside a Claude
  Code session) over the unreliable `/plugin` slash commands,
  and drop the non-existent `claude plugin add --local`
  subcommand from the local-development path

## 0.65.0 — Hook Performance & Control

Released 2026-04-19

### Features

- **Shorten session startup by consolidating hooks** —
  SessionStart now runs 5 features in one orchestrator (Stop
  runs 2), replacing 8 `uv run --project` wrappers with
  direct-shebang scripts so every session feels faster without
  paying uv project resolution and CLI import cost per hook
  ([GH-959](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/959))
- **Surface per-hook execution timing for latency triage** —
  `@audit_hook` plus an `audit-wrap` shell wrapper capture
  body-phase and total (including uv startup) timing per
  invocation to `/tmp/Dev10x/logs/hooks-*.jsonl`, with
  `dev10x hook audit summary` and `prune` subcommands so slow
  hooks are diagnosable before users complain ([GH-860](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/860))
- **Let users dial hook strictness per session** — validator
  specs now carry `rule_id` (DX001–DX008), `profile`
  (minimal/standard/strict), and `experimental` flags, so
  `DEV10X_HOOK_PROFILE`, `DEV10X_HOOK_DISABLE`, and
  `DEV10X_HOOK_EXPERIMENTAL` can drop opinionated rules for
  throwaway work while keeping safety-critical guardrails on
  shared-repo commits ([GH-413](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/413))
- **Guide users to reconnect MCP instead of bypassing hook** —
  when the `Dev10x_cli` MCP server is unavailable, use-tool
  block messages now instruct the agent to ask the user to
  reconnect rather than fall back to wrapper scripts or reach
  for `DEV10X_SKIP_CMD_VALIDATION`, which users reject for
  transient outages ([GH-957](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/957))

## 0.64.0 — Platform Reach & Merge Safety

Released 2026-04-18

### Features

- **Support multi-platform installs via unified CLI** — register
  any AI assistant (Claude Code, Copilot, Windsurf, Continue,
  Cursor, or custom targets) with `dev10x platform add/list/remove`
  so Dev10x can extend beyond its original two-host scope without
  per-user path editing ([GH-908](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/908))
- **Automate PyPI publishing on release tags** — `v*` tag pushes
  publish the `dev10x` package via OIDC trusted publishing, so
  users can `pip install Dev10x` for CI scripts and hook
  integration without manual upload steps ([GH-953](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/953))
- **Guide new users through Dev10x onboarding** — `dev10x init`
  seeds starter config and prints a Next 5 Commands quick-start
  card, replacing the zero-direction `/help` landing with a
  frictionless guided setup ([GH-906](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/906))
- **Prevent silent merges past unresolved CI checks** —
  `Dev10x:gh-pr-merge` now blocks on `PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or
  any `bucket:fail` state and requires an explicit reason for
  override, closing the gap that shipped a bundle while e2e was
  still running ([GH-955](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/955))
- **Enforce instruction budget for large skills** — new
  `dev10x skill count-instructions` command measures actionable
  instructions and warns when skills exceed the 150-instruction
  reliability threshold from QRSPI research ([GH-882](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/882))
- **Offer structured retry after rejected commands** — when a
  user rejects a CLI command, `Dev10x:skill-reinforcement` now
  fires `AskUserQuestion` with retry/manual/cancel options
  instead of a plain-text follow-up that could silently auto-
  advance ([GH-952](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/952))
- **Prefer bundled PR for same-milestone multi-issue work** —
  `Dev10x:work-on` auto-selects a bundled PR strategy when all
  tickets share a milestone under solo-maintainer mode, cutting
  N branch switches, CI cycles, and merges down to one
  ([GH-948](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/948))
- **Enable MCP glob enumeration in upgrade-cleanup** — new
  `dev10x permission enumerate-mcp` subcommand replaces
  `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_*` wildcards with enumerated tool names,
  eliminating the manual approval prompts Claude Code fires when
  globs silently match nothing ([GH-947](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/947))
- **Enable Supabase env bootstrap in worktree hooks** — post-
  checkout hooks now copy `.env.supabase` into new worktrees so
  local Supabase connectivity works without manual file copying
  ([GH-946](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/946))

### Refactors

- **Isolate Dev10x scratch files under /tmp/Dev10x/** — plugin
  scratch files, session state, and the mktmp binary moved from
  the shared `/tmp/claude/` namespace to `/tmp/Dev10x/`, letting
  users scope allow rules to plugin-only paths ([GH-949](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/949))

### Chores

- **Keep scheduled_tasks.lock out of version control** — the
  session-local scheduler lock file is now gitignored so it
  cannot land alongside unrelated skill changes ([GH-955](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/955))

  them ([GH-938](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/938))
- **Prevent ACC review-requested from failing solo mode** —
  review-requested checks are skipped in solo-maintainer mode
  where no reviewers are ever assigned ([GH-939](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/939))
- **Resolve upgrade-cleanup broken script flags** — MCP tool
  routes ensure-base, generalize, and ensure-scripts to Python
  functions directly instead of passing invalid CLI flags
  ([GH-936](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/936))

### Refactors

  hardcoded versioned path with ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} variable
  ([GH-806](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/806))
- **Prevent session state race between sessions** — atomic
  os.rename() claim prevents two concurrent sessions from
  reading and deleting the same state file ([GH-816](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/816))

### Security

  invocation exemptions and push safety documented ([GH-475](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/475))

### Bug Fixes

- **Prevent marking PR ready with unaddressed comments** —
  post-CI comment re-check catches late bot reviews ([GH-465](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/465))

### Security

- **Enforce git-commit skill via PreToolUse hook** — raw
  `git commit` blocked; must use Dev10x:git-commit ([GH-473](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/473))

### Tests

- **Ensure dispatcher tests match commit hook rules** —
  test suite validates hook-to-skill routing ([GH-473](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/473))

## 0.40.0 — Delegation Hardening & Fixup Skill Gaps

Released 2026-03-26

  architecture, and infrastructure agents now ship with the plugin
  for use on any codebase ([57e3830])
- **Quiet mode for update-paths.py** — suppress noisy output when
  running permission path updates ([GH-428](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/428))
- **Allow git reset without permission friction** — reset commands
  no longer trigger unnecessary approval prompts ([GH-441](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/441))

### Improvements

- **Promote review agents to plugin distribution** — domain-specific
  reviewer agents moved from internal to plugin-distributed so all
  users benefit ([23229f3])
- **Rebrand repo from dev10x-ai to Dev10x** — repository name,
  URLs, and marketplace references updated ([#442])
- **Tighten work-on approval gate and routing** — stricter approval
  flow prevents unintended auto-advance past decision gates ([GH-429](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/429))

### Bug Fixes

- **Prevent permission-maintenance bootstrap loop** — break the
  cycle where permission maintenance triggers itself ([GH-426](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/426))
- **Prevent stale permissions after worktree merge** — merged
  worktree rules are cleaned up so they don't cause false
  allow/deny matches ([GH-427](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/427))

### Documentation

- **Prevent misclassification of hook-enabled rules** — clarify
  that allow rules enabling hooks must not be removed even when

## 0.38.0 — Brave-Labs Rebrand & Version Visibility

Released 2026-03-24

### Features

- **Version visibility in marketplace** — plugin description now
  leads with the installed version (e.g., `v0.38.0`) so users
  can tell at a glance what they're running
- **Automatic version in description** — bumpversion config
  updates both the `version` field and the description prefix
  in plugin.json

### Improvements

- **Repo rename to Brave-Labs** — all URLs, marketplace commands,
  and installation docs updated from `Brave-Labs/dev10x-ai` to
  `Brave-Labs/Dev10x`
- **Skill count update** — README and plugin description now
  reflect 59 skills (was 40)

### Bug Fixes

- **Restore PR comment and review tools** — re-enable
  `pr_comment_reply` and review MCP tools that were
  inadvertently disabled ([GH-422](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/422))

### Documentation

- **Data-driven skill redirect ADR** — propose friction-level
  based redirect system for hook validators ([GH-417](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/417))

## 0.37.0 — Skill Compliance Enforcement

Released 2026-03-24

Agents can no longer bypass skill delegations or use raw CLI
commands where skills exist. A new PreToolUse hook auto-denies
known CLI anti-patterns, SKILL.md enforcement markers prevent
inline handling of sub-skill operations, and a new MCP tool
eliminates the permission friction that incentivized bypasses.

### Features

- **Auto-deny wrong-tool drift** — PreToolUse hook blocks raw
  CLI commands (git commit -m, gh pr create, git push) that
  should go through skill wrappers, while allowing skill-internal
  patterns like -F and --fixup ([GH-397](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/397))
- **Frictionless PR comment replies** — new `pr_comment_reply`
  MCP tool replaces raw `gh api` calls in gh-pr-fixup,
  gh-pr-respond, and gh-pr-triage, removing per-invocation
  Bash permission prompts ([GH-399](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/399))

### Improvements

- **Sub-skill delegation enforcement** — gh-pr-respond gains
  REQUIRED: Skill() markers at all 5 delegation points (triage,
  fixup, groom, push, monitor), plus branch location pre-check
  and stash guard in git-groom ([GH-400](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/400))
- **Review delegation bypass prevention** — gh-pr-respond adds
  negative instruction prohibiting manual fixes; skill-reinforcement
  gains workflow-context checking for delegation bypasses ([GH-401](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/401))
- **Audit-driven skill hardening** — gh-pr-respond, gh-pr-fixup,
  and git-fixup gain mandatory markers for parallel dispatch,
  test gates, and CWD pre-checks based on audit findings ([GH-407](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/407))
- **Eval schema for Skill() assertions** — evaluation schema
  documents Skill() invocation assertion patterns, enabling
  detection of enforcement bypass regressions ([b90c5de])

[b90c5de]: https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/dev10x-claude/commit/b90c5de

## 0.36.0 — PR Monitor Visibility & MCP Bugfix

Released 2026-03-23

PR monitoring reports full status context, and the MCP
pr_comments tool resolves a parameter mapping bug that
blocked all comment operations.

### Features

- **PR monitor status reporting** — monitor agent surfaces
  CI check details, unhandled review comments, and reviewer
  assignment status instead of completing silently ([GH-392](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/392))

### Bug Fixes

- **pr_comments parameter mapping** — fix `--pr-number` to
  `--pr` in cli_server.py so reply, resolve, and thread
  operations work correctly ([GH-393](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/393))

## 0.35.0 — Orchestration Integrity & Maintenance Skills

Released 2026-03-22

Skill delegation is enforced end-to-end, new maintenance skills
catch memory rot and playbook drift before they cause failures,
and CI deduplication eliminates wasted review runs.

### Features

- **Memory health auditing** — new `Dev10x:memory-maintenance`
  skill detects stale paths, script-calling instructions,
  contradictions, and MEMORY.md index drift ([GH-375](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/375))
- **Playbook drift detection** — new `Dev10x:playbook-maintenance`
  skill compares user overrides against defaults, surfacing new
  steps and prompt changes with severity levels ([GH-366](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/366))
- **Skill-usage reinforcement** — orchestration skill identifies
  CLI commands that should be replaced by dedicated skills or MCP
  tools, with prefix-matched command-to-skill mapping ([GH-384](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/384))
- **Project settings cleanup** — permission-maintenance gains
  Step 6 to strip duplicate, wildcard-covered, and stale rules
  from project settings files ([GH-386](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/386))
- **CI SHA deduplication** — GitHub Actions workflows skip
  redundant runs when a peer workflow already handles the same
  commit SHA ([GH-382](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/382))

### Improvements

- **Skill delegation enforcement** — work-on requires post-step
  Skill() verification and prohibits pipeline collapse during
  fanout execution ([GH-367](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/367))
- **CI re-monitoring after force push** — git-groom and work-on
  mandate `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` after any force push to avoid
  stale CI results ([GH-371](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/371))
- **Task reconciliation after delegation** — work-on reconciles
  parent task state after child skill completion, preventing
  orphaned tasks ([GH-376](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/376))
- **Wrong-database prevention** — db-psql requires target database
  comment prefix on manual SQL and sets PGAPPNAME for process
  identification ([GH-363](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/363))
- **Scope-aware fanout parsing** — fanout distinguishes scope URLs
  from specific item URLs, restricting scans to matching commands
  ([GH-351](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/351))
- **Skill routing through compaction** — compaction preservation
  directive keeps routing tables intact across context compression
  ([GH-358](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/358))
- **Unmatched play fallback** — work-on routes unmatched plays to
  the feature play instead of failing, and bans merge operations
  in gh-pr-monitor ([GH-357](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/357))
- **CWD-based worktree detection** — ticket-branch detects
  worktree context from current working directory ([GH-353](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/353))
- **Auto-filing audit findings** — skill-audit findings file
  automatically as GitHub issues ([GH-356](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/356))
- **Nested-mode task exemption** — formalized exemption for
  TaskCreate in nested skill invocations ([GH-355](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/355))

### Bug Fixes

- **Auditor deny-rule overreach** — permission-auditor now uses
  three-tier classification (deny/ask/hook-protected/skip) instead
  of blanket deny recommendations that blocked legitimate skills
  ([GH-385](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/385))
- **Premature completion gate** — work-on completion gate no longer
  fires before all tasks are finished ([GH-354](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/354))
- **Explore agent source failures** — GitHub/JIRA fetch subagents
  switched from Explore to general-purpose to gain Bash access
  ([GH-348](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/348))

## 0.34.0 — Fanout Safety & Skill Consistency

Released 2026-03-21

Fanout delegation is hardened against bypass and wrong-branch
commits, and trigger/skip documentation is standardized across
all skills.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fanout delegation safety** — prevent delegation bypass and
  wrong-branch commits with stricter orchestration guards
  ([GH-345](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/345))

### Improvements

- **Trigger/skip standardization** — consistent trigger and skip
  documentation across all skills, completing the effort started
  in v0.33.0 ([GH-313](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/313))

## 0.33.0 — Orchestration Discipline & Session Resilience

Released 2026-03-21

Fanout enforces structured work-on delegation, session state
survives compaction and restarts, and acceptance criteria
verification becomes a reusable skill.

### Features

- **Session resilience** — pre-compaction hook preserves critical
  context, session state persists across restarts, and skill
  invocation metrics are tracked for audit ([GH-310](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/310)–[GH-317](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/317))
- **Fanout orchestration discipline** — work-on delegation is now
  REQUIRED with enforcement language, per-issue subtask tracking,
  and new Monitor + Audit phases ([GH-338](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/338), [GH-339](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/339))
- **Full shipping pipeline in gh-pr-respond** — post-response
  continuation expanded from groom+push+monitor to the complete
  groom → push → ready → monitor → merge lifecycle with
  solo-maintainer auto-merge support ([GH-338](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/338), [GH-339](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/339))
- **Reusable definition-of-done verification** — extracted
  `Dev10x:verify-acc-dod` skill for consistent acceptance checks
  across work-on, fanout, and future orchestrators ([GH-340](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/340))

### Improvements

- **Task tracking in DDD and permission-maintenance** — both skills
  gain TaskCreate/TaskUpdate orchestration for supervisor visibility
  ([GH-41](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/41))
- **Statusline enrichment** — branch name and worktree context shown
  in terminal statusline ([GH-312](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/312))
- **Skill scaffolding** — `Dev10x:skill-create` generates directory
  structure with scripts via `scaffold.sh` ([GH-314](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/314))
- **Plugin health verification** — install and verify scripts validate
  plugin structure after updates ([GH-315](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/315))
- **Marketplace metadata** — enriched `marketplace.json` for better
  plugin discovery ([GH-317](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/317))
- **Trigger/skip standardization** — consistent trigger and skip
  documentation across 13+ skills ([GH-313](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/313))

## 0.32.0 — Permission Friction & Review Hardening

Released 2026-03-20

Permission friction eliminated across skill-audit, project-scope, and
py-uv skills. Code review agents gain stricter verification checks,
and work-on enforces playbook verification before plan generation.

### Features

- **Playbook verification in work-on** — Phase 3 now requires reading
  and verifying a playbook file before generating tasks, preventing
  ad-hoc plan generation that skips configured steps ([GH-308](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/308))
- **GitHub async timing checks** — code review agents detect stale
  `gh pr checks` results after force-pushes by verifying check count
  against expected baselines ([GH-318](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/318))
- **Table/implementation skew detection** — code review agents flag
  documentation tables that diverge from actual implementation

### Improvements

- **Reduced permission friction** — normalized `scripts/:*` to
  `scripts/*:*` across all `allowed-tools` declarations in skill-audit,
  py-uv, skill-create, and codex-skills equivalents ([GH-321](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/321))
- **Smarter sensitive file hook** — `block-sensitive-file-write.py` now
  uses basename matching instead of substring, eliminating false
  positives on sidecar metadata files like `.vars` ([GH-322](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/322))
- **Project-scope anti-patterns** — documented command substitution and
  env var prefix friction patterns to avoid in `gh` commands, switched
  sidecar files from `.env` to `.vars` ([GH-322](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/322))
- **Autosquash alias prefix** — `env` command prefix added to
  `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true` in autosquash aliases for consistent
  shell expansion ([GH-319](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/319))
- **Skill name normalization** — Dev10x skill names normalized across
  documentation and scripts for consistency
- **Semicolon false positive fix** — SQL safety hook no longer blocks
  semicolons inside string literals like `STRING_AGG(name, '; ')`
  ([GH-320](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/320))

### Bug Fixes

- **Skill-audit permission prompt** — `extract-session.sh` no longer
  triggers approval prompts on every invocation due to mismatched
  `allowed-tools` glob pattern ([GH-321](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/321))

### Documentation

- **Updated skill pattern references** — all `scripts/:*` documentation
  examples updated to `scripts/*:*` across skill-audit, skill-create,
  and their codex-skills equivalents ([GH-309](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/309))

## 0.31.0 — MCP Consolidation & Parallel Workflows

Released 2026-03-20

MCP servers consolidate from 4 to 2, PR creation runs through native
MCP tools, macOS Keychain credentials land, and work-on gains parallel
stream processing with context compaction.

### Features

- **MCP tools for PR creation** — 6 gh-pr-create scripts and pr-notify
  wrapped as 7 MCP tools in gh_server.py, enabling dual-path transition
  with existing Bash paths ([GH-191](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/191))
- **Universal branch aliases** — git log, diff, rebase, and autosquash
  aliases now support main and master alongside existing develop,
  development, and trunk variants ([GH-288](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/288))
- **Non-destructive CTE in db queries** — db hook allows WITH clauses
  that don't modify data, unblocking analytical queries ([GH-303](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/303))
- **Slack thread investigation** — new plugin skill investigates Slack
  bug reports, root-causes in codebase, and creates Linear tickets
  ([#298])
- **Guided Slack integration setup** — interactive skill walks through
  Slack app creation, token configuration, and channel setup ([GH-14](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/14))
- **macOS Keychain credential retrieval** — secrets can be stored and
  retrieved via macOS Keychain as an alternative to env vars ([GH-119](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/119))

### Improvements

- **MCP server consolidation** — reduced from 4 servers to 2 (cli →
  git + utils, gh stays), cutting startup overhead ([GH-194](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/194))
- **Parallel work stream processing** — work-on dispatches independent
  tasks concurrently instead of sequentially ([#301])
- **Context compaction in orchestration** — skills compact context at
  phase boundaries to stay within token limits ([#299])
- **Work-on audit enforcement** — audit findings from GH-295, GH-296,
  GH-297 enforced as playbook and eval updates ([#300])
- **False positive prevention** — shared code patterns (MCP imports,
  PEP 723 inlining) no longer trigger review warnings ([#294])
- **Broader permission maintenance** — permission update workflow
  covers more path patterns and project configurations
- **Playbook pattern documentation** — reviewer guidance for validating
  playbook-powered skills and reference file patterns ([#243])
- **External tool declaration requirements** — skill authors must
  declare all external tool dependencies in SKILL.md front matter
  ([#270])
- **Invocation-name enforcement** — reviewer checklist enforces
  mandatory invocation-name field with exact-match rule ([#267])

### Testing

- **Automated hook testing** — pytest CI pipeline validates hook
  scripts with unit tests ([GH-214](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/214))
- **CI concurrency groups** — prevent duplicate CI runs on rapid
  pushes to the same branch ([GH-214](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/214))

### Bug Fixes

- **Non-interactive autosquash** — autosquash aliases wrap
  GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true to avoid escaping issues that broke alias
  expansion ([GH-288](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/288))

## 0.30.0 — Disciplined Orchestration

Released 2026-03-19

Work-on orchestration gets guardrails — mechanical plan generation,
mandatory phase tasks, and supervisor sign-off prevent shortcuts.
Git-domain skills gain MCP tool access, session skills get aligned
names, and script-path leaks are eliminated across the tooling surface.

### Features

- **MCP tool access for git skills** — git-domain skills can call MCP
  tools directly instead of shelling out via Bash wrappers ([GH-192](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/192))
- **Permission management skill** — base permission management enables
  structured allow/deny rule handling ([GH-274](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/274))
- **Slack file cleanup** — cleanup Slack config files and prompt for
  missing configuration ([GH-271](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/271))
- **Goodbye message** — session exit shows a resume command so users can
  pick up where they left off ([GH-272](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/272))
- **Block `$(cat ...)` substitution** — hook blocks command substitution
  via `cat` to prevent file content leaks in shell commands ([GH-277](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/277))

### Improvements

- **Aligned session skill names** — 11 session skills get consistent
  `Dev10x:` prefixed invocation names ([GH-224](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/224), [GH-102](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/102))
- **Script-path leak elimination** — skill tooling no longer leaks
  resolved cache paths in allowed-tools or Bash calls ([GH-280](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/280),
  [GH-275](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/275), [GH-283](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/283))
- **Destructive git commands ADR** — documented the decision to block
  destructive git operations by default ([GH-269](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/269))
- **Orchestration guardrail evals** — eval assertions enforce Phase 3
  mechanical planning and supervisor sign-off ([GH-248](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/248), [GH-273](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/273))

### Bug Fixes

- **Supervisor sign-off required** — plan completion gate now requires
  explicit supervisor confirmation instead of auto-completing ([GH-273](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/273))
- **Natural language plan mapping** — phrases like "show me the plan"
  route to AskUserQuestion gate, not plan mode ([GH-248](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/248))
- **Mechanical Phase 3** — plan generation enforces 1:1 task-to-step
  mapping from playbook, preventing step collapsing ([GH-248](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/248), [GH-273](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/273))
- **Phase task verification** — Phase 2 blocked until all 4 phase tasks
  are confirmed to exist ([GH-248](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/248))
- **ExitPlanMode prohibition** — work-on sessions cannot use Claude
  Code's built-in plan mode, preserving task tracking ([GH-248](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/248))
- **MCP-aware subagent routing** — Phase 2 fetches requiring MCP tools
  (Linear, Slack, Sentry) route to general-purpose agents, not Explore
  agents which lack MCP access ([GH-155](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/155))

## 0.29.0 — Smoother Shipping

Released 2026-03-16

Worktrees handle Husky v4 and Yarn Berry correctly, fish shell stops
breaking GraphQL queries, and delegated skills skip redundant task
tracking for faster unattended execution.

### Improvements

- **Unattended PR creation** — gh-pr-create supports `--unattended` flag
  with documented detection conditions and gate bypass rules ([GH-263](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/263))
- **Delegated skills skip TaskCreate** — skills invoked as subtasks of a
  parent orchestrator skip internal task tracking, reducing noise ([GH-258](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/258))
- **Body-only review handling** — gh-pr-respond Mode B handles reviews with
  body text but no inline comments, common from CI bots ([GH-258](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/258))
- **Non-skippable monitor output** — gh-pr-monitor Step 4 marked as
  non-skippable so users always see background agent progress ([GH-259](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/259))
- **Reduced work-on friction** — workspace detection extracted to script,
  implicit plan approval when user provides a complete plan ([GH-253](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/253))
- **Friction-free grooming** — raw GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR rebase replaced with
  git autosquash-develop alias to avoid env-prefix permission friction ([GH-253](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/253))

### Bug Fixes

- **Husky v4 and Yarn Berry in worktrees** — detect Husky version, bootstrap
  ~/.huskyrc for v4, use version-aware yarn install flags ([GH-222](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/222))
- **Fish shell GraphQL compatibility** — convert GraphQL examples to
  double-quoted with escaped `$` to prevent fish interpolation ([GH-258](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/258))

## 0.28.0 — Conflict-Free PRs

Released 2026-03-16

PRs now auto-detect and resolve merge conflicts before they reach reviewers.
MCP servers start reliably, and jq queries no longer trigger false-positive
obfuscation blocks.

### Improvements

- **Conflict-free PRs** — PR creation and monitoring detect merge conflicts
  via `git merge-tree` and GitHub's mergeable API, with auto-rebase +
  force-with-lease resolution ([GH-261](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/261))
- **Consistent skill naming** — 9 skills get proper `Dev10x:` invocation
  names with documented branding rationale ([GH-234](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/234))
- **Friction-free issue status checks** — jq concatenation pattern replaces
  interpolation to avoid obfuscation detection ([GH-260](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/260))
- **Full changelog** — all 22 releases (v0.2.0–v0.27.0) documented with
  themed headlines and linked issue references
- **MCP server permission review checks** — reviewer-infra now explicitly
  requires `+x` on server scripts

### Bug Fixes

- **MCP server startup** — 3 server scripts (db, gh, git) were missing
  execute permissions, causing "Permission denied" on startup

## 0.27.0 — Self-Healing Code Review

Released 2026-03-15

The shipping pipeline now fixes its own review findings autonomously.
Also: GitHub Issues support in project-scope and auto-approval for safe
subshell commands.

### Features

- **Self-healing code review** — work-on shipping pipeline now dispatches
  `Dev10x:review` + `Dev10x:review-fix` to autonomously create fixup commits
  for review findings ([GH-252](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/252))
- **Full task visibility in unattended mode** — git-commit and gh-pr-create
  create all startup tasks regardless of mode; auto-skipped tasks are
  immediately marked completed with reason ([GH-251](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/251))
- **GitHub Issues in project-scope** — Phase 3 Tracker Dispatch now supports
  GitHub Issues alongside Linear and JIRA, with batch creation pattern for
  10+ issues ([GH-244](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/244))
- **Auto-approval for safe subshells** — new `HookAllow` result type lets
  read-only subshell commands like `basename "$(git rev-parse ...)"` pass
  without permission prompts ([GH-247](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/247))
- **Worktree permission merging** — merge allow rules accumulated in worktree
  sessions back into the main project settings
- **Batch plugin permission updates** — auto-detect latest plugin version
  and update stale versioned paths across all projects in one pass

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent path errors when CWD drifts during session ([GH-251](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/251))

## 0.26.0 — Release Notes as a Skill

  with configurable ticket patterns, output targets (stdout/GitHub/Slack),
  and release/hotfix plays

## 0.25.0 — Unattended Shipping

Released 2026-03-15

Skills can now commit, format, and ship without human intervention.
Playbook fragments eliminate duplication, unattended git-commit bypasses
all interactive gates, and ruff formatting runs automatically on every
Python edit.

### Features

- **Reusable playbook fragments** — extract shared step sequences (like the
  9-step shipping pipeline) into named fragments, reducing duplication from
  36 of 55 steps across 4 plays ([GH-232](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/232))
- **Unattended git-commit** — when invoked by an orchestrating skill with
  an active task list, all interactive gates are bypassed: auto-stage,
  auto-select commit type, auto-generate problem/solution ([GH-237](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/237))
- **Automated ruff formatting** — PostToolUse hook runs `ruff format` +
  `ruff check --fix` on every Python file edit ([GH-231](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/231))
- **Post-response shipping continuation** — gh-pr-respond now offers to
  groom, push, and monitor CI after fixup commits ([GH-225](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/225))
- **Redundant command detection** — hook blocks `git -C <path>` when CWD
  already matches, and `cd <cwd> && ...` noop chains ([GH-225](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/225))
- **Respond playbook comment hiding** — gh-pr-respond can hide obsolete
  review comments after addressing them ([GH-226](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/226))
- **uv-managed test execution** — pyproject.toml with pytest/ruff dev deps
  so `uv run pytest` works without extra flags ([GH-225](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/225))

### Bug Fixes

- **Skill-audit enforcement gaps** — AskUserQuestion rule extended to global
  scope, Linear API fallback for non-autolinked prefixes ([GH-227](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/227))
- Ensure release script stages pyproject.toml after bump

## 0.24.0 — Auto-Advance Pipeline

Released 2026-03-14

The shipping pipeline no longer blocks on preview approval. Commits and
draft PR creation proceed automatically with a code-reviewer agent step.

  approval prompts ([GH-70](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/70))

## 0.22.0 — Playbook Architecture

Released 2026-03-12

The biggest architectural release to date. Work plans become reusable,
customizable playbooks. The hook dispatcher consolidates 7 processes into
one with ~80% overhead reduction. User-space config overrides ship.

### Features

- **Playbook architecture** — generalize work plans into reusable,
  customizable playbooks with convention-based discovery. Any orchestration
  skill can become playbook-powered by adding `references/playbook.yaml`.
  User overrides stored per-skill in memory ([GH-209](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/209))
- **Guided work plan customization** — dedicated `Dev10x:work-plan` skill
  with list, view, edit, and reset subcommands ([GH-209](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/209))

  with one unified Python dispatcher using a validator registry.
  ~80-85% hook overhead reduction ([GH-208](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/208))
- **User-space config overrides** — `~/.claude/skill-index/` for
  `families.yaml` and `hidden.yaml` without modifying plugin source ([GH-10](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/10))
- **Alias enforcement** — block raw `git` commands with env-var prefixes
  or `$(git merge-base ...)` subshells when aliases exist ([GH-200](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/200))
- **Automated issue closing** — GitHub Actions workflow parses `Fixes:` URLs
  from merged PR bodies and closes referenced issues ([GH-209](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/209))

### Refactoring

- Split reviewer-skill into structure and behavior specs
- Trim CLAUDE.md to stay within 100-line budget

## 0.20.0 — Reliable Skill Orchestration

Released 2026-03-09

Numbered lists replace code blocks across 39 skills so decision gates and
orchestration steps actually fire instead of being skipped as examples.

### Features

- **Bundled call spec pattern** — complex tool call specifications live
  in `tool-calls/` sidecar files, referenced from SKILL.md enforcement
  markers ([GH-179](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/179))
- **Numbered list enforcement** — 39 skills updated to use numbered lists
  (not code blocks) for mandatory TaskCreate/AskUserQuestion calls ([GH-179](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude2/issues/179))
