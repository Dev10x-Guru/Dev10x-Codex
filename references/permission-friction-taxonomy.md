# Permission Friction Taxonomy

The classification vocabulary for permission friction: what kinds of
friction exist, which class a given defect belongs to, and what the
standing diagnosis of the system is.

Companion to [`permission-architecture.md`](permission-architecture.md),
which covers the *mechanism* — how Claude Code evaluates a tool request
and where hooks sit in that order.
This file covers the *problem model* laid over that mechanism.

Migrated from the GH-1100 tracker, which carried it as issue prose
while twenty-plus issues cited it.
Provenance of the tracker lineage:

> #271 · #488 · #726 → #796 → #912 · #925 · #1007 → #1069 · #1076 ·
> #1090 → #1100

GitHub preserves the rest of the history; what is reproduced here is
only the part that existed nowhere else.

## Friction Types A–G

The coarsest cut: what *kind* of thing went wrong, before asking which
subsystem owns it.

| Type | Friction |
|---|---|
| A | Unseeded safe surface |
| B | Wrong rule shape |
| C | Hook hard-wall |
| D | Verb-blind wrapper |
| E | Wrong-tool routing |
| F | Background-context-generated |
| G | Should-not-run-inline |

Plus the **sensitivity overlay axis**, which is orthogonal to A–G rather
than an eighth type — it asks what the command *targets*, not what shape
it took.
It shipped as DX014; see
[`cedar-sensitivity-annotation.md`](cedar-sensitivity-annotation.md) and
`.claude/rules/hook-patterns.md` § DX014.

The tracker carried this taxonomy in exactly the compressed form above
and never expanded the seven labels into definitions.
They are reproduced as found rather than back-filled with invented
descriptions.
Where a letter's meaning is not obvious, the class map below is the
sharper instrument — it names a mechanism and an owner.

The adjacent enumerations the tracker referenced — **Gaps G1–G18**,
**Scope S1–S20**, **Decisions D1–D16** — were never migrated because
they are readable in #488's history, which is closed but intact.

## Friction Class Map

The load-bearing table.
Classes **A–J** were established in #1090 and **K–O** in #1076.
K–O are not reducible to A–J — different mechanisms, different
subsystems — and were flagged as the thing most at risk of being lost in
a consolidation.

Cite a class by its letter — `class L` — the way the issue corpus
already does.

| Class | Mechanism | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| A | User-scope dirs granted per-project only | catalog + `ensure-workspace` (directory axis) |
| B | Invocation-form / spelling aliasing | catalog schema (`spellings:` expansion) |
| C | Cross-worktree grant propagation | repo-stem keying (`pin_tracker` precedent) |
| D | Release-lag: new MCP tools prompt until maintenance re-runs | maintenance / upgrade |
| E | Option-2 catch-all on deliberately-excluded commands | eliminate-at-source > narrow entry > grant |
| F | `ask`-rule precedence, no refinement path | docs done (#1095); DX014 extension to settings-file asks open |
| G | `allowed-tools:` does not grant | `ensure-scripts` + CLAUDE.md doctrine |
| H | Rule-proof shapes (brace / simple expansion) | hook validators / templates — not catalog |
| I | Out of scope by ruling | param-normalization follow-up / by-design |
| J | Catalog split-brain | needs an ADR |
| K | Worktree runtime-state hygiene — `.claude/session/plan.yaml` is per-checkout, gitignored, no lifecycle owner, no branch-affinity check at load; recycled worktrees inherit stale plans | `domain/documents/plan.py`, `seed_worktree` — not a permission defect |
| L | CWD-forced chaining defeats rule matching — a subagent dispatched into a worktree must `cd <path> && …`, shifting the effective prefix so no allow rule can ever match; the option-2 grant it offers will not match the chained form next time either | dispatcher-side (`isolation="worktree"`, explicit `cwd`) |
| M | Own-tool enumeration drift — Dev10x's own released MCP tools never back-filled into already-seeded settings (`resolve_gate` since v0.83.0, ~15 tools since v0.90). Distinct from D | maintenance re-seed |
| N | Flag-based core checks + steer collision — `jq -f <shipped-filter>` blocked as "dangerous flags"; the check is target-blind. The plugin's own jq-over-inline-code doctrine steers into the blocked shape | core-check classification + `structured-alternatives.yaml` |
| O | Background-dispatch pre-seed gap — a background agent is offered no persistence option at all (Yes / auto-mode / No), and dispatchers often omit the preamble/wrapper pre-seed | dispatcher contract (`background_preamble`) |

### There is no class P, Q or R

The GH-1100 extraction map refers in passing to "the class map A–R".
No such rows ever existed — the map ends at O.
Treat a citation of `class P` or beyond as a reference to something
that was never written, not as a pointer to a row this file is missing.

## Diagnosis D0–D5

The standing read on *why* friction persists.
D0 is the frame; D1–D5 are the confirmed defects under it.

**D0 — the model is sound, the plumbing is not.**
An unattended run with a complete preflight shape catalog produced zero
prompts.
Every confirmed defect below is a completeness or propagation failure
rather than a design failure, which is what rules out a redesign.

**D1 — catalog split-brain. CONFIRMED.**
The legacy `skills/upgrade-cleanup/projects.yaml` is the sole write path
into `settings.local.json`; `baseline-permissions.yaml` contributes zero
rules — `migrate_flat_config` reads it only for tier/sensitivity
metadata.
ADR-0021 names the legacy file and never mentions the newer one, so
naming a single authority is an **ADR amendment, not a doc fix**.
This is class J, and it gates the scoped work under it.

**D2 — the precedence doc contradicted itself.**
Fixed in #1095.
The surviving statement of the rule lives in
[`permission-architecture.md`](permission-architecture.md)
§ Permission Group Tier Assignment ("Tier is intent, not delivery") and
§ Docs-vs-Evidence Caveat.
Do not restate it here; those sections are the live copy.

**D3 — `allowed-tools:` grants nothing.**
No directory-form rule exists in any settings file; `ensure-scripts`
enumerates per-file from disk, so the declared `Bash(<dir>/:*)` shape is
never written and a script added after the last run has no rule.
A skill that declares a tool it has not had catalogued still prompts on
every call — see `.claude/rules/mcp-tools.md`
§ "A registered tool is not a pre-approved tool".

**D4 — version-pinned paths orphan grants.**
Every release invalidates path-pinned rules until maintenance re-runs.

**D5 — measurement.**
Hook block records now carry `rule_id` / `reason` (#1095).
Settings-file prompts still have **no telemetry** — they never reach a
hook, which is why the tracker this file came from had to be
hand-transcribed.

## Standing Decisions

Rulings made on the tracker that survive it, and should not be
relitigated without new evidence.

- **`--dedupe-global` is not retired.**
  It mirrors `clean --aggressive` and stays as an opt-in flag.
  Retiring it has been proposed and declined.

## Where the PAP model lives

GH-1100 carried a PAP / PDP / PEP target-architecture sketch.
It is not reproduced here, because the repo already documents it in two
places and a third copy would be the split-brain this file's own D1
warns about:

- [`cedar-sensitivity-annotation.md`](cedar-sensitivity-annotation.md)
  — the three-axis PAP action model (tier × reversibility ×
  sensitivity), deny-overrides resolution, and the mapping of PDP + PEP
  onto Claude Code's PreToolUse hook infrastructure.
- [`domain/authz-patterns.md`](domain/authz-patterns.md) — the general
  PAP / PDP / PIP / PEP definitions as domain patterns.

**PAP expands to Policy Administration Point** (GH-1333) — the XACML
sense that pairs with PDP / PIP / PEP in `authz-patterns.md`, not the
two local coinages that used to collide with it: "Permission
Abstraction Protocol" and "Permission Access Policy" are retired
spellings. Both prior forms have been corrected at their sites
(`cedar-sensitivity-annotation.md`, `docs/specs/GH-271-phase0-handoff.md`,
`tests/fixtures/permission-friction/README.md`); this is the one place
that records the retirement, so a reader who meets either spelling
elsewhere in history (closed issues, `CHANGELOG.md`) knows it means the
same thing.
