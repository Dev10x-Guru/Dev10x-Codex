# Permission Architecture

How Claude Code evaluates tool requests, and how hooks interact
with the permission layer.

## Execution Order

When an agent requests a tool call (e.g., `Bash(git push origin)`),
Claude Code processes it in this order:

```
Agent requests tool call
  │
  ├─ 1. Deny rules  → if matched, BLOCKED (hooks never run)
  ├─ 2. Ask rules    → if matched, user prompted
  ├─ 3. Allow rules  → if matched, ALLOWED silently
  ├─ 4. No rule match → generic permission prompt
  │
  └─ 5. PreToolUse hooks run (only if steps 1-4 allowed)
         └─ Hook can BLOCK with systemMessage
         └─ Hook can ALLOW (or not respond)
```

Rules are evaluated `deny → ask → allow` and the **first match
wins** — so a broad `ask` rule cannot be narrowed by a more
specific `allow`. Source: [Claude Code permissions
docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions.md). The
§ "Why deny rules cannot fix the footgun" section below depends
on this ordering; keep the two consistent.

**Not to be confused with `resolve_effect()`** — the Dev10x
resolver in `src/dev10x/domain/common/policy_resolution.py`
models a *different* axis: precedence **between config tiers**
(project-local / user-private / plugin-default), where any deny
wins outright, then the highest tier with a match decides, and
`ask` beats `allow` only within a single tier. It does not model
the deny/ask/allow ordering above, and it is CLI-only (PAP-6 /
GH-868 deferred live hook integration). Do not cite it as
evidence for engine rule-category ordering.

**Key insight:** Hooks only execute after the permission layer
passes. A deny rule prevents both the tool call AND the hook.
An allow rule silences the permission prompt AND enables the hook.

## Hook-Enabled Allow Rules

Some allow rules exist not to permit the command, but to ensure
a PreToolUse hook can fire its redirect message. Without the
allow rule, step 4 fires a generic "approve?" prompt before the
hook runs at step 5.

### SkillRedirectValidator

The `SkillRedirectValidator` hook blocks raw CLI commands and
redirects to skill equivalents with educational messages:

| Allow rule | Hook blocks | Redirects to | Guardrails |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `Bash(gh pr create:*)` | `gh pr create` | `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` | Job Story, ticket linking |
| `Bash(git push:*)` | `git push` | `Dev10x:git` | Protected branches, force-push safety |
| `Bash(git rebase -i:*)` | `git rebase -i` | `Dev10x:git-groom` | Atomic commits, conventions |
| `Bash(git commit -m:*)` | `git commit -m` | `Dev10x:git-commit` | Gitmoji, JTBD title, 72-char |
| `Bash(gh pr checks:*)` | `gh pr checks --watch` | `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` | Failure detection, fixups |

These allow rules are classified as `HOOK_ENABLED` in permission
audits. Removing them degrades UX — the user sees a generic
permission prompt instead of an educational redirect.

### Adding New Hook-Enabled Rules

When adding a new SkillRedirectValidator entry:

1. Add the regex pattern to `skill_redirect.py`
2. Add the corresponding allow rule to `settings.json`
3. Add the pattern to `HOOK_ENABLED_PATTERNS` in
   `clean-project-files.py` so it isn't stripped as redundant
4. Verify the redirect message fires correctly

## Implications for Tooling

| Tool | Implication |
|------|------------|
| `permission-auditor` agent | Must classify hook-enabled rules as `HOOK_ENABLED`, not `DEAD_RULE` |
| `clean-project-files.py` | Must detect and skip hook-enabled rules during cleanup |
| `plugin-maintenance` skill (invoked directly or via `upgrade-cleanup`) | Must not strip hook-enabled rules from project settings |

## Proactive Safe-Command Allowlist (GH-310)

An unsupervised (adaptive / AFK) session treats every permission
prompt as a **hard stop** — there is no human to answer it, so the
session cannot complete. The same prompt is also the trigger for
Claude Code's option-2 "Yes, and don't ask again for…" feature,
which strips a command down to its broadest prefix and writes a
catch-all `Bash(<verb> *)` rule into the user's allow list.

### Why deny rules cannot fix the footgun

A natural instinct is to ship `deny` rules for the catch-all shapes
(`Bash(git *)`, `Bash(gh *)`, …). This **backfires**. Claude Code
evaluates rules in the order `deny → ask → allow`, and the first
match wins, so a deny always beats a more-specific allow. The space
in `Bash(git *)` is a trailing wildcard equivalent to `:*`, so the
pattern matches **every** `git <args>` command. A `deny: Bash(git *)`
would therefore also block `git status`, `git log`, and every other
git subcommand — for every plugin user — even with
`allow: Bash(git status:*)` present.

Source: [Claude Code permissions docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions.md)
— "Rules are evaluated `deny → ask → allow`; the first matching rule
wins" and "`Bash(git *)` matches `git log --oneline --all`".

### Mid-path wildcards are unverified (GH-1135)

Whether a `*` in the **middle** of a `Bash(...)` rule matches at all
is an open empirical question — ADR-0021 records it as "not
addressed" and GH-925 F2 restates it. It is not academic: the only
allow-list shape that can cover the read-only git plumbing spelling
an agent emits from a worktree is a mid-path one:

```
Bash(git --git-dir=* --work-tree=* status:*)
```

Those rules ship in `base_permissions`, restricted to read-only verbs
and in both argument orderings agents emit. The
`permission-investigator` matrix now carries a `mid_path_star`
wildcard cell in `DEFAULT_WILDCARDS` so the shape is measured rather
than assumed.

**Record the result here when the cell runs.** If it reports
`PROMPTED`, the shape is un-allow-listable: drop these rules and flip
`git-dir-worktree-pinning` in `command-skill-map.yaml` to
`hook_block: true`, so the agent gets a deterministic steer to
`git -C <repo> <verb>` and the supervisor never sees the prompt — or
its `git *` option 2. Either outcome satisfies the standing rule that
a structurally unmatchable shape gets a deterministic answer, never a
prompt carrying a dangerous default.

| Cell | Result | Recorded |
|------|--------|----------|
| `Bash.*.mid_path_star.*` | not yet run | — |

### Interpreter footguns are hook-enforced (GH-469)

The most dangerous `Bash(<verb> *)` catch-all is the interpreter one
(`bash *`, `sh *`, `zsh *`, `python3 *`) — it grants arbitrary code
execution and a total rule bypass. Protection for these does **not**
rely on a permission deny-rule (which is unreliable: it does not
suppress the option-2 UI footgun and does not reliably merge
global→project). Instead, the `DX003` execution-safety validator
(`src/dev10x/validators/execution_safety.py`, `MINIMAL` profile) runs
on **every** Bash call and blocks inline code (`bash -c`, `python3 -c`)
and untrusted absolute script paths, steering to the Write-tool /
uv-script pattern or an approved dir (`~/.claude/{tools,skills,hooks}/`,
`/tmp/Dev10x/`).

**Rule of thumb:** footgun catch-alls are **hook-enforced** (a
PreToolUse validator that always runs); permission deny-rules are
**belt-and-suspenders** — a defensive second layer, never the primary
guard.

### The fix: pre-approve the safe surface

The only safe defense is to **enumerate the safe commands as `allow`
rules** so the prompt never fires and option-2 never gets the chance
to write a catch-all. The catalog lives in
`skills/upgrade-cleanup/projects.yaml` under `base_permissions:` and
is propagated into each project's `settings.local.json` by
`uvx dev10x permission ensure-base`.

What belongs in the catalog (safe to auto-approve):

- Read-only filesystem / text inspection (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `rg`,
  `stat`, `wc`, `diff`, …) — never mutate state.
- `--version` / `--help` info flags for execution-capable verbs.
- Read-only subcommands of rich verbs (`git show`, `git rev-parse`,
  `gh release view`, `gh workflow list`, `uv pip list`, …).

What is deliberately excluded (keeps prompting, routes to a skill,
or is forbidden by a hook):

- Arbitrary code execution — `python -c`, `sh -c`, `bash -c`,
  `eval`, and package runners (`npx <pkg>`, `pnpm dlx <pkg>`,
  `pipx run <pkg>`, `bunx <pkg>`).
- Network fetch-and-exec or exfiltration — `curl <url>`,
  `wget <url>` (only `--version` is allowed).
- Destructive filesystem operations.
- Env-prefixed commands (`env VAR=x cmd`) — tracked under GH-311.
- The bare-verb catch-alls themselves (`Bash(git *)`, etc.).

The upstream UI defect that generates the catch-all is tracked
separately (GH-312); this allowlist is the defense-in-depth that
keeps unattended sessions moving without it.

### WebFetch documentation domains (GH-369)

`WebFetch` is its own permission entity class, distinct from `Bash`.
A rule has the shape `WebFetch(domain:<host>)` and matches a single
fully-qualified host over HTTPS. Routine documentation lookups (read
the Django docs, check a Pydantic page, open an MDN article) prompt
per-domain on first access — GH-271 evidence recorded 6+ distinct doc
domains in one session, each a fresh stall for an unattended run.

The `webfetch-public-docs` group (tier 2) pre-approves a curated set
of ~30 canonical documentation hosts so these fetches never prompt.
Scope rules for the catalog:

- **HTTPS documentation hosts only** — reference content, not API
  endpoints. A docs host serves read-only pages; pre-approving it
  cannot fetch-and-exec or exfiltrate.
- **One FQDN per rule** — `WebFetch(domain:docs.python.org)`, not a
  wildcard `*.python.org`. Explicit hosts keep the approved surface
  auditable and prevent a broad subdomain from silently covering an
  API or upload endpoint.
- **Not for arbitrary URLs** — fetching a non-doc host still prompts,
  by design. The catalog is a curated allowlist, not a blanket
  WebFetch permit.

## Permission Group Tier Assignment

Each group in `baseline-permissions.yaml` is assigned a tier that records
the *intended* scope — whether it should ship as a plugin default or
require user opt-in.

| Tier | Scope | Intended shipping | Examples |
|------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | Universal dev tools | Plugin default | git, gh, uv, ls, cat, grep |
| 2 | Routine doc/ref fetches, plugin infrastructure | Plugin default | webfetch-public-docs, dev10x-cli, mktmp |
| 3 | Project-specific or cost-bearing | User opt-in | railway-cli, obsidian-cli |

> **Tier is intent, not delivery (GH-1095).** These tiers do **not**
> currently determine what reaches a project's `settings.local.json`.
> `ensure-base` renders exclusively from the flat catalog in
> `skills/upgrade-cleanup/projects.yaml`; `migrate_flat_config` loads
> `baseline-permissions.yaml` only to attach `tier`/`group`/
> `sensitivity` metadata to rules **already present** in the flat
> catalog, and never contributes a rule of its own. A tier-1 group
> that exists solely in `baseline-permissions.yaml` therefore ships
> to nobody. Naming a single authoritative catalog is tracked on
> GH-1090 and needs an ADR amending ADR-0021.

**Tier 1 criteria**: Commands present in every development workflow, safe to
auto-approve unconditionally. Examples: `git show`, `gh issue view`,
`uv pip list`.

**Tier 2 criteria**: Routine commands that would prompt every session without
pre-approval, stalling unattended runs. Primary drivers: GH-271 evidence
(6+ doc domains in one session, multiple plugin scripts). Not universal across
all projects, but frequent enough that pre-approval prevents friction. Scoped
conservatively to read-only surfaces (doc hosts, not API endpoints).

**Tier 3 criteria**: Project-specific tooling, cost-bearing (CI triggers),
or infrastructure tied to specific deployments. Examples: Railway deployment
CLI (org-specific), Obsidian vault CLI (project-specific). Opt-in via user
config in `projects.yaml` § `base_permissions` for projects that need them.

### Review Checklist for New Groups

When evaluating a new permission group:

- **Tier 1**: Only add if the command is present in 90%+ of projects
- **Tier 2**: Justify via GH-271 friction evidence — how often would this
  stall? Include evidence from issue/PR discussion (e.g., "6+ doc domains hit")
- **Tier 3**: Document why the group is project-specific; confirm no universal use

## Docs-vs-Evidence Caveat (finding #47)

Official Claude Code docs state that permission rules merge across
scopes rather than override ("rules from global settings are inherited
into project settings"). **Treat this as intended, not actual
behavior.**

Empirical evidence from [#47](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/47)
(closed by [#50](https://github.com/Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude/issues/50))
establishes the opposite: when a project has its own
`settings.local.json`, the **local file wins** and global rules are
not always inherited. Practical consequences:

- A project-level rule that is an exact duplicate of a global rule is
  NOT necessarily redundant — the project copy may be the only active
  copy for that project's sessions.
- `dev10x permission clean` removes exact duplicates of global rules
  by default (historical behavior). Use `--skip-global-dedup` to
  suppress this when inheritance cannot be verified.
- The `permission-investigator` skill and `permission-auditor` agent
  are the authoritative sources for per-project rule coverage; trust
  their output over the upstream documentation.

### The write path no longer assumes inheritance (GH-1136)

`clean --aggressive` was made opt-in on the evidence above, but both
*write* paths — `ensure_base()` and `seed_worktree()` — still encoded
the opposite assumption: each filtered the rendered catalog against
`~/.claude/settings.json` before writing. Because `include_user_settings`
puts the global file in the settings-file list, the first run seeded
global with the whole catalog and every later run found everything
"already in global" and wrote nothing to any project file. Every catalog
addition made after global was first seeded was a no-op for every project
— measured at 137 of 285 rules missing, including `ls`, `rg`, `git show`,
all 16 `git <base>-*` aliases and 38 MCP tools.

Both functions now write the full catalog by default. `dedupe_global=True`
(CLI: `--dedupe-global`) restores the old behaviour behind an explicit
opt-in, mirroring the `clean --aggressive` posture. Two further
guarantees ride along: a git-tracked `settings.json` is never written
(only `settings.local.json`), and a residual gap after a real write is an
error rather than silence.

`dev10x permission catalog-gap` reports the gap read-only, grouped by
rule family, and exits non-zero when any file is short — so "does this
file carry the catalog?" is a command, not an inference from a
maintenance log.

**Rule of thumb:** do not cite the "permissions merge" docs as a
reason to remove a project rule. Run `dev10x permission investigate`
or check `permission-auditor` findings instead.

## Hook Load-Once Semantics (GH-407)

Claude Code loads hooks **once at session start** from
``$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT``. An on-disk ``claude plugin update``
installs a newer version into the cache but does **not** hot-swap
the running hooks — the session continues executing the pre-upgrade
hooks until it is restarted.

Practical implications:

- A shipped bug-fix in a validator (e.g., DX012 `safe-expansion`
  for single-quoted brace expressions) is dormant in sessions that
  predated the upgrade. The fix tests green in CI but still produces
  friction in those live sessions.
- The stale hooks can inflate friction evidence: a false-positive that
  a newer validator suppresses still fires in old sessions, making it
  look like an unfixed regression.
- The **settings-staleness** check (`build_install_check_context`) and
  the **running-hook** check (`build_hook_version_drift_context`) are
  distinct. Settings can be refreshed by upgrade-cleanup without
  restarting the session; the running hooks remain stale until restart.

The **hook version drift detector** (SessionStart feature
`session-hook-version-drift`) addresses this:

1. Reads the running version from ``$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/plugin.json``
   (set by Claude Code at session start).
2. Scans ``~/.claude/plugins/cache/<publisher>/<slug>/`` for the
   highest-installed version.
3. On mismatch, emits:
   *"Dev10x hooks running v0.72.0 but v0.76.0 is installed on disk.
   Restart this session (or run `/Dev10x:upgrade-cleanup`) to activate
   shipped friction fixes, validators, and catalog improvements."*
4. Returns an empty string when running == latest or when either
   version is unresolvable (``--plugin-dir`` dev installs bypass the
   cache, so no drift signal is raised).

**Regression note:** when a "shipped fix still fails" report arrives,
check hook-version drift *before* assuming a logic regression. Confirm
the session was started after the fix was installed by comparing the
running-hook version against the fix's release tag.
