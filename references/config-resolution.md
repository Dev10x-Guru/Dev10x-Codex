# Configuration Resolution

Central reference for Dev10x configuration file paths, resolution
order, and project mapping format.

## Where the Dev10x config root lives

Throughout this doc and Dev10x skills, `<Dev10x config>` is the
canonical placeholder for the user-global config root. It resolves
per platform (and overrides):

| Resolution order | Path | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (override) | `$DEV10X_CONFIG_HOME` | Set explicitly (tests, CI, custom layouts) |
| 2 (override) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Dev10x` | `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set |
| 3 (Windows) | `%APPDATA%/Dev10x` | e.g. `C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Roaming\Dev10x` |
| 4 (default) | `~/.config/Dev10x` | Linux, macOS, BSDs |

Source of truth: `src/dev10x/domain/dev10x_paths.py` (`_platform_default_root`).
When examples in this doc or SKILL.md files write
`~/.config/Dev10x/...`, that is the Linux/macOS form — substitute
the platform-appropriate root from the table above.

**From the shell**, the resolved root is available as the
bare-invocation output of the `dev10x` CLI:

```bash
$(uvx dev10x)/gitmoji.yaml
# → /home/<user>/.config/Dev10x/gitmoji.yaml on Linux
# → /Users/<user>/.config/Dev10x/gitmoji.yaml on macOS
# → C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Dev10x\gitmoji.yaml on Windows
```

`dev10x config root` is the explicit equivalent — both print
the same path. Use whichever reads better in your script.

## Three-Tier Resolution

All Dev10x configuration files follow a consistent resolution order
(project-local → global → plugin defaults):

| Priority | Location | Scope | Committed? |
|----------|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 (highest) | `.claude/Dev10x/` | Project-local | No (gitignored) |
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/` (XDG; legacy `~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/`) | Global with repo mapping | N/A (user home) |
| 3 (lowest) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/*/references/` | Plugin defaults | Yes (plugin repo) |

**Tier 1 — Project-local** (`.claude/Dev10x/`):
Runtime and session data. Highest priority for truly project-specific
overrides that should not be shared across repos. Gitignored.

**Tier 2 — Global with repo mapping** (`~/.config/Dev10x/`):
Single file serves multiple projects via `projects[].match` globs.
Preferred for overrides that apply to several repos (e.g., all
ExampleCorp repos share the same shipping pipeline).

> **Note (GH-941):** The old `~/.claude/projects/<key>/memory/`
> path is removed. All tier 2 config lives under
> `~/.config/Dev10x/`.
>
> **Note (GH-215):** Dev10x userspace config moved out of
> `~/.claude/` to the XDG location: `~/.config/Dev10x/` on
> Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%/Dev10x/` on Windows. Override via
> `DEV10X_CONFIG_HOME`. Legacy paths under `~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/`
> and `~/.claude/Dev10x/` are migrated lazily on first read and
> explicitly by `dev10x config migrate` (wired into
> `Dev10x:upgrade-cleanup` and `Dev10x:plugin-doctor`).

**Tier 3 — Plugin defaults** (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/*/references/`):
Shipped with the plugin. Used when no user override exists.

## Project Mapping Format

Global config files (Tier 2) use a `projects` list whose entries carry a
glob. **Two addressing schemes exist, and the key name says which**
(ADR-0026):

| Key | Compared against | Files |
|---|---|---|
| `match_repo:` | the repo's `nameWithOwner` — `org/repo` | `playbooks/<skill>.yaml`, `settings-pr-merge.yaml`, `gitmoji.yaml` |
| `match:` | an **absolute directory path** | `friction.yaml` |

Both use standard Unix glob syntax (`fnmatch`): `*` matches any string
— **including `/`** — `?` matches a single character, `[seq]` matches
any character in *seq*.

> **Deprecated alias.** `match:` is still accepted in a repo-addressed
> file for one release, so an existing playbook keeps working. Rename it
> to `match_repo:`; `dev10x config doctor` and `dev10x playbook diff`
> report every entry still on the alias.

```yaml
projects:
  - match_repo: "Dev10x-Guru/dev10x-claude"
    # config specific to this repo

  - match_repo: "org/*"
    # config shared across all ExampleCorp repos
```

**Resolution within Tier 2 (repo-addressed files):**
1. Get current repo: `git remote get-url origin` → extract `owner/repo`
2. Walk the `projects` list — first `match_repo` glob that fits selects
   the config block (`match:` is read as the deprecated alias)
3. If no match, skip Tier 2 (fall through to Tier 3 or 4)

**No `origin` remote.** Step 1 has a failure case: a local-only repo, a
clone whose remote is named something other than `origin`, or a
detached checkout has no `owner/repo` to extract. Tier 2 is then **not
evaluated at all** — which is a different outcome from "evaluated, no
entry matched", and the tools say which: `dev10x config doctor` reports
the list as NOT evaluated and names the reason. Repo-addressed Tier 2
config cannot apply to such a checkout; move the settings to Tier 1
(`.claude/Dev10x/`) or add an `origin` remote.

### The portable `*/<repo>` form

Because `fnmatch`'s `*` spans `/`, a glob written `*/<repo>` resolves
under **both** schemes: it matches `owner/repo` with `*` absorbing the
owner, and `/work/dx/repo` with `*` absorbing the parent directories.
An org-form glob does not travel — `Dev10x-Guru/*` never matches a
directory path — which is exactly the mistake the two key names now
make visible.

Treat `*/<repo>` as a convenience, not a contract: the overlap holds
because of `fnmatch` semantics, not by design. The named keys are the
guarantee.

## Configuration Files

### Playbooks

| Tier | Path | Format |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | `.claude/Dev10x/playbooks/<key>.yaml` | Standard playbook YAML |
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/playbooks/<key>.yaml` | Playbook + `projects` mapping |
| 3 | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<key>/references/playbook.yaml` | Default playbook |

**Global playbook format** (Tier 2):

```yaml
# ~/.config/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml

fragments:
  shipping-pipeline-solo:
    - subject: Code review
      type: detailed
      skills: [dev10x:review, dev10x:review-fix]
    # ...

projects:
  - match_repo: "Dev10x-Guru/dev10x-claude"
    active_modes: [solo-maintainer]
    overrides:
      - play: feature
        steps:
          - subject: Set up workspace
            type: detailed
            skills: [dev10x:ticket-branch]
          # ...

  - match_repo: "example-org/*"
    active_modes: [solo-maintainer]
    overrides:
      - play: feature
        steps: [...]
```

**Resolution order:** Check Tier 1 first, then Tier 2 with repo
matching, then Tier 3 (plugin defaults).

### Session Config

| Tier | Path | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 2 only | `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml` | Global, keyed by `projects[].match` dir globs |

This is the one file whose `match:` is **not** an `org/repo` glob — it
is compared against the checkout's absolute directory path, keyed by
the git common dir so one entry covers every worktree (ADR-0018 D3).
Copying a `Dev10x-Guru/*` glob here selects nothing.

Session prefs are **not** project-local (ADR-0018 D1). `friction_level`,
`active_modes`, `allowed_overlays`, and the `gate_*` keys live in one
global file keyed by directory-path globs, so a repo's prefs cover
every worktree by construction. Read them via
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate`, which owns the precedence.

The retired `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml` is not a tier: ADR-0018 D2
removed it as a config source, and D5 moved its remaining task-index
role to `~/.config/Dev10x/task-index/<repo-stem>.yaml` (reached via the
`task_index_*` MCP tools, never Write/Edit).

### PR Merge Settings

| Tier | Path | Format |
|------|------|--------|
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/settings-pr-merge.yaml` | Settings + `projects` mapping |

**Global format** (Tier 2):

```yaml
# ~/.config/Dev10x/settings-pr-merge.yaml
projects:
  - match_repo: "Dev10x-Guru/*"
    strategy: rebase
    delete_branch: true
    solo_maintainer: true
  - match_repo: "example-org/*"
    strategy: rebase
    delete_branch: true
    solo_maintainer: true
```

### Acceptance Criteria


| Tier | Path |
|------|------|
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/dod-acceptance-criteria.yaml` |
| 3 | Plugin defaults (hardcoded in skill) |

`Dev10x:verify-acc-dod` falls back to the GH-941-retired
`~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/dod-acceptance-criteria.yaml` for one release
when tier 2 is absent, and says so in its output when the fallback
fires. That fallback is **read-only** — overrides are always written to
the tier-2 path above. Until GH-1035 the skill named the legacy path as
its sole location while this table named the tier-2 one, so a
maintainer's edits landed in a file nothing read.

### Gitmoji Overrides


| Tier | Path |
|------|------|
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/gitmoji.yaml` |
| 3 | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-commit/references/gitmoji-defaults.yaml` |

### Database Schema

| Tier | Path |
|------|------|
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/db-<name>-schema.md` |

### GitHub Reviewers

| Tier | Path |
|------|------|
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/github-reviewers-config.yaml` |

### Slack Config

| Tier | Path |
|------|------|
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/slack-config.yaml` |

### Slack Code Review Requests

| Tier | Path |
|------|------|
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/slack-config-code-review-requests.yaml` |

### Plugin Maintenance Preferences

| Tier | Path |
|------|------|
| 2 | `~/.config/Dev10x/plugin-maintenance-prefs.yaml` |

Valid values for `update_preference`: `both | plugin | uv | skip | ask`.
When absent or set to `ask`, `Dev10x:plugin-maintenance` prompts on
every run. Legacy path `~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/plugin-maintenance-prefs.yaml`
is migrated lazily on first read.

### Database Connections

`databases.yaml` stores named database entries for `Dev10x:db-psql`.
The script resolves config from multiple locations so project plugins
(e.g., `tt:db`) are discovered automatically without symlinks.

| Priority | Path | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | `$DB_CONFIG` | Explicit override; skips all other locations |
| 2 | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/db-psql/databases.yaml` | Plugin-shipped defaults |
| 3 | `~/.config/Dev10x/databases.yaml` | **Preferred** user-global location (XDG) |
| 4 | `~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/databases.yaml` | Deprecated fallback (kept for backward compat) |
| 5 | `skills/*/databases.yaml` | Sibling skills in the same plugin |
| 6 | `~/.claude/skills/*/databases.yaml` | User-installed standalone skills |
| 7 | `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/*/skills/*/databases.yaml` | Other marketplace plugins |

**Recommended setup**: place your user-level `databases.yaml` at
`~/.config/Dev10x/databases.yaml` (priority 3). The legacy
`~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/databases.yaml` path still works but is
deprecated; migrate to the XDG location when convenient.

`$DB_CONFIG` env-var override is not recommended in Claude Code
sessions — prefixing a `DB_CONFIG=...` env var shifts the effective
command prefix and breaks allow-rule matching (see GH-448).
