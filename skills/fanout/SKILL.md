  Process multiple independent work items as a worktree-isolated
  swarm — each item runs the full Dev10x:work-on lifecycle inside
  its own background Agent with isolation="worktree". Honors
  dependencies, minimizes conflicts, auto-advances by default.
  TRIGGER when: 2+ independent work items need parallel processing
  (PRs, issues, tickets).
  DO NOT TRIGGER when: single task or sequential dependency chain
  (use Dev10x:work-on); already running as a swarm child (see
  recursive-fanout guard).

# Dev10x:fanout — Parallel Work Stream Orchestrator

Close multiple open loops in parallel while honoring
dependencies and minimizing conflicts. Each item runs its full
pipeline — no collapsed shipping sequence.

## Instructions

The full workflow — 6-phase execution model, permission-aware
dispatch, parallel group management, completion gate — lives in
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. `TaskCreate` calls and the Strategy
`AskUserQuestion` gate documented there are REQUIRED.

**End-to-end read enforcement (GH-166, GH-1279): this file does
NOT fit in one `Read`.** The first call returns a truncated
`PARTIAL view` and stops around line 1209 of 1451. Keep issuing
`Read(offset=…)` until you reach the final line — the tail holds
the teardown decision tree and the Phase 5 comment-resolution
gate, and a truncated read drops both while looking complete.
If you did not see the last line, you have not read the contract.
