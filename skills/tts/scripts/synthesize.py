"""Synthesize narration audio, and lay it out on a timeline.

Two engines sit behind one entry point, because neither covers the job
alone: **Kokoro** ships Apache-2.0 weights but no Polish, and **Piper**
has five Polish voices but only one English voice that permits commercial
use. So this script routes by language rather than picking a winner — the
engine is inferred from the voice name's shape, which is unambiguous
(``af_heart`` is Kokoro, ``pl_PL-gosia-medium`` is Piper), so callers pass
a voice exactly as before and never name an engine.

Subcommands, each printing JSON to stdout:

``check``   preflight — is the engine on PATH, is the voice installed,
            what is it licensed for, has the supervisor accepted it.
            Reports availability for BOTH engines, and fails only when the
            *resolved* one is missing.
``pin``     persist the supervisor's voice choice to
            ``~/.config/Dev10x/tts.yaml`` so it is asked once, not per run.
            ``--lang`` pins a per-language voice.
``batch``   segments in, WAVs out.
``track``   timed segments in, one mixed voice-over WAV out.

Four properties are load-bearing:

1. **One piper process per batch.** Model load dominates a short run —
   measured 1.0s for three lines together against ~0.7s each when run
   separately. Piper emits one WAV per *line* of its input, so a batch is
   one N-line file, not N files.
2. **Kokoro pays that load per segment, and says so.** ``kokoro-tts``
   takes one input file and emits ONE audio file; ``--split-output``
   chunks by size, not by line, so there is no way to recover a per-line
   mapping from a batched run. One process per segment is the only
   correct shape — and it is ~5s each, against Piper's ~1s for a whole
   batch. Prefer Piper for long scripts where the timbre allows it.
3. **Output is mapped by position, never by parsing an engine's log.**
   Piper's ``--output-dir-naming timestamp`` writes monotonically-named
   files in line order, so sorting a *freshly created empty* directory
   recovers the input order; the count is asserted against the input
   length, so a surprise in piper's output shape fails loud instead of
   silently pairing the wrong audio with the wrong caption. Kokoro needs
   no inference at all — each segment is told its own output path.
4. **A voice licence is reported, never enforced.** Most good English
   piper voices are CC BY-NC-SA, and whether a given recording is
   commercial use is the supervisor's call, not this script's. An
   unaccepted non-commercial voice yields a ``warning`` in the payload and
   ``licence_accepted: false`` — the caller decides whether to gate on it.
   Kokoro's weights are Apache-2.0, so the English default never warns.

Stdout is parsed by callers, so errors are emitted as ``{"error": ...}``
on **stdout** (not stderr) and the process still exits non-zero — a
consumer parses one channel and never sees empty stdout on failure.
