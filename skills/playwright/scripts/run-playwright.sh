# run-playwright.sh — Safe Playwright runner for staging QA
#
# Usage:
#   run-playwright.sh <script.py> [--validate-only]
#                     [--user <username> | --profile <suffix>]
#                     [--staging-url <url>] [--secrets-file <path>]
#                     [--tail <n>]
#
# What it does:
#   1. Reads CF Access + CRM credentials from settings.secrets.env
#   2. Validates the Python script syntax (py_compile) before launching a browser
#   3. Exports credentials as env vars (never hardcoded in scripts)
#   4. Runs: VIRTUAL_ENV="" uv run --with "$PLAYWRIGHT_SPEC" python3 <script.py>
#
# Nothing deployment-specific is baked in (GH-1130). Every knob below is
# an environment override with a documented default, and the account map
# is read from the secrets file rather than a case statement — so a third
# credential pair needs no edit to this script, and nobody has to fork it
# and lose the two guarantees it exists to provide.
#
#   STAGING_URL              base URL the scripts hit
#   PLAYWRIGHT_SECRETS_FILE  where the credentials live
#   PLAYWRIGHT_DEFAULT_USER  username when the secrets file names none
#   PLAYWRIGHT_PROFILE       default credential suffix (see below)
#   PLAYWRIGHT_SPEC          the pinned playwright requirement
#
# The two knobs a per-run invocation must set also have flag forms —
# --staging-url and --secrets-file — because an environment prefix is
# what defeats permission matching: an allow rule keys on the command
# prefix, and `STAGING_URL=… run-playwright.sh` does not start with the
# script path (GH-1263). Precedence is flag > env > default, so every
# existing caller's environment keeps working. --tail exists for the
# same reason: `| tail -40` extends the command past the rule too.
#
# Accounts are keyed by an optional suffix on the secrets-file keys:
#
#   CRM_USERNAME=…   CRM_PASSWORD=…     -> the default profile
#   CRM_USERNAME2=…  CRM_PASSWORD2=…    -> --profile 2, or --user <its username>
#
# Scripts must read credentials via os.environ:
#   CF_CLIENT_ID, CF_SECRET, CRM_USERNAME, CRM_PASSWORD, STAGING_URL
#
# Scripts import the shared annotation module via os.environ:
#   DEV10X_PLAYWRIGHT_LIB  (skills/playwright/lib)
#   DEV10X_TTS_SCRIPT      (skills/tts/scripts/synthesize.py, for narration)

# Bounded, like every other dependency pin in this repo (GH-916). An
# unbounded `--with playwright` resolves to whatever is newest on each
# run: one release refused to install a browser at all on a current
# Linux distro, and reported it as "does not support chromium on
# <distro>" — an error that points at the OS rather than the resolver
# (GH-1129).
