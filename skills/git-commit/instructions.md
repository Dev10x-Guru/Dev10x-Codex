# Create Commit (Instructions)

## Overview

This skill creates properly formatted git commits following project conventions:
- Gitmoji prefix based on change type
- Ticket reference extracted from branch name
- 72 character title limit
- Structured body with solution points
- Proper footer with ticket reference

## Guiding Principle: User-Facing Outcomes

**Shift the perspective from what changed in the code to what it enables for the actor.** The same principle drives Job Stories — the "so [beneficiary] can" clause captures the outcome, not the mechanism. This applies to commit titles, PR titles, ticket titles, and branch grooming.
Use the project or ticket language for Job Stories and user-story prose;
when BDD or Gherkin-derived keywords appear, use Cucumber's official
language reference: https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/languages/

- Bad: `Add DEVICES_READ to Square OAuth scopes` (implementation)
- Good: `Enable automatic terminal discovery` (outcome)
- Bad: `Add Square location ID GraphQL query` (implementation)
- Good: `Enable multi-location payment routing` (outcome)
- Bad: `Add customer_id column to invoices table` (implementation)
- Good: `Link invoices to customer records` (outcome)

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns
(Tier: Standard).

**Auto-advance:** Complete each step and immediately start the next — no checkpoints the resolver did not ask for.
Never pause between steps to ask "should I continue?".

**REQUIRED: Create tasks before ANY work.** Execute these
`TaskCreate` calls at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Gather commit context", activeForm="Gathering context")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Draft commit message", activeForm="Drafting message")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Review and approve", activeForm="Reviewing message")`
4. `TaskCreate(subject="Create commit", activeForm="Creating commit")`

Set sequential dependencies: draft blocked by gather, review blocked
by draft, create blocked by review.

**Nested-mode exemption:** When invoked as a nested skill within
a parent orchestrator (e.g., via `Skill()` from `Dev10x:work-on`),
the four startup tasks above are condensed into **exactly one**
summary task — not zero. The parent's task list provides phase
visibility; the nested summary task makes the commit step itself
visible. See `references/task-orchestration.md` § Delegated
Invocation Exception.

Required nested-mode startup call:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Commit outstanding changes", activeForm="Committing")`

Mark this task `in_progress` on entry and `completed` after the
commit succeeds (or `deleted` if the run aborts). Skipping the
task entirely is a compliance violation — it leaves the parent
orchestrator with no record that the commit step ran.

**Decision gates in nested mode:** ALL `AskUserQuestion` gates
documented below are skipped only when **both** unattended-mode
conditions in the next paragraph are met (invoked via
`Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)` AND the parent has an active task
list). When in doubt — for example, when called from a script
or one-off invocation with no parent task list — default to
**attended mode** and fire all gates. "Nested" alone does not
imply "unattended"; the active-task-list signal is what
authorizes auto-advance.

**Task creation in unattended mode (top-level only):** All 4
startup tasks MUST be created when running as a top-level
invocation. When a task's work is auto-skipped (e.g., "Review
and approve" in unattended mode), still create the task via
`TaskCreate` and immediately mark it `completed` with description
"Auto-skipped: unattended mode". This preserves supervisor
visibility into the full workflow.

**Unattended mode:** When this skill is invoked by an
orchestrating skill (e.g., `Dev10x:work-on`, `test:fix-flaky`,
`Dev10x:git-promote`) and the orchestrator has already approved
the work plan, all interactive decision gates are bypassed:
- Staging → auto-stage all changes
- Commit type → auto-select from context
- Problem/solution → auto-generate from session context
- Preview → resolved by `resolve_gate(gate="artifact_preview")`
  at Step 9 (see below) — not hardcoded to skip here
- Next steps → return control to orchestrator immediately

Detection: unattended mode activates when **both** conditions
are met:
1. The skill is invoked via `Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)` (not
   directly by the user via `/Dev10x:git-commit`)
2. The caller is executing a plan step with an active task
   list (i.e., an orchestrating skill like `work-on`)

When either condition is absent, default to **attended mode**
with all interactive gates. When in doubt, default to attended.

**Decision gates (attended mode) — REQUIRED: Call
`AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text) at each of these
points. In unattended mode, these gates are skipped:

- **Staging approval** (when unstaged changes exist):
  **REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text,
  call spec: [ask-staging.md](./tool-calls/ask-staging.md)).
  Options:
  - Stage all (Recommended) — git add -A
  - Stage specific files — user specifies which files
  - Abort — cancel commit

- **Commit type selection** (gitmoji):
  **REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text,
  call spec: [ask-commit-type.md](./tool-calls/ask-commit-type.md)).
  Options:
  - Feature — new functionality
  - Fix — bug fix
  - Refactor — code restructuring
  - Test — adding or updating tests

- **Message preview approval** is NOT governed by the
  attended/unattended fork above. It is resolved via
  `resolve_gate(gate="artifact_preview")` at Step 9 in every
  invocation (nested or top-level) — see Step 9 for the full
  branch pattern. When the resolved effect is `ask`, fire the
  EXISTING widget (call spec:
  [ask-message-preview.md](./tool-calls/ask-message-preview.md))
  with options: Commit (Recommended) / Edit message / Abort.

## Scope Invariant (GH-153)

**One commit scope per invocation.** If a second unrelated change
surfaces mid-flow (e.g., during staging review, the agent spots an
incidental edit in a different module), finish the current
invocation first, then re-invoke `Dev10x:git-commit` for the new
scope. Do NOT extend the in-flight invocation to cover multiple
scopes.

**Recovery for a blocked raw `git commit`:** When the PreToolUse
hook denies a raw `git commit -F <path>` you reached for mid-flow
because a second scope appeared, the correct response is to:

1. Complete the current `Dev10x:git-commit` invocation with the
   original scope.
2. Re-invoke `Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)` for the new scope.

**Do NOT reach for env-level hook bypasses as a workaround.** Hook
overrides live in the hook layer, not at the skill caller — see
`.claude/rules/hook-patterns.md`. See
`references/commit-examples.md` for atomic commit guidance.

## Prerequisites Check

**IMPORTANT:** Verify git state before committing:

1. Check if we're in a git repository
2. Check if there are staged or unstaged changes
3. Check current branch (should not be develop/main/master,
   unless `supervisor_review_status()` reports a pinned
   `supervisor_review: "none"` — see the escape below)
4. Verify branch follows naming convention (username/TICKET-ID/[worktree/]description)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Ready to commit changes with proper formatting
- Want to ensure commit follows project conventions
- Need help formatting commit message
- Want ticket reference auto-extracted from branch

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Git State

**CWD safety check — resolve worktree root first:**

Before any git commands, verify CWD is the repository/worktree
root. Prior commands in the session (e.g., `pnpm test`) may
have left CWD in a subdirectory, causing `git add` to interpret
repo-root-relative paths as CWD-relative — producing broken
double-nested paths like `apps/web/apps/web/src/...`.

```bash
git rev-parse --show-prefix
```

If the output is non-empty, CWD is a subdirectory. Get the
repo root and reset CWD in two separate steps (never chain
with `&&`):

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

Then use the returned path directly:

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/repo/root
```

This avoids the `cd "$(git rev-parse ...)" && ...` pattern
which hooks block due to subshell + chaining friction.

**Never `git -C <path>`:** `git -C` breaks allow-rule matching
in `settings.local.json`. Always use `cd` to the repo root
first (above), then run git commands without `-C`.

**Check repository status:**
```bash
# Verify in git repo
git rev-parse --git-dir

# Get current branch
BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)

# Check for changes
git status --porcelain
```

**No-PR-workflow escape (GH-57):** Before applying the base-branch
block, call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__supervisor_review_status()`.
Skip the develop/main/master block only when it reports BOTH
`supervisor_review: "none"` and `pinned: true` — a single-author
project with no PR workflow, deliberately recorded in the durable
`~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml`. Requiring `pinned` keeps the
escape auditable: the safe unset default (`required`) never opens
it. Never read `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml` for this — it is
retired (ADR-0018) and the tool owns the precedence (ADR-0022 D-2).

**Validations:**
- ❌ If not in git repo → Error: "Not in a git repository"
- ❌ If on develop/main/master AND the escape does not apply →
  Error: "Cannot commit directly to develop/main/master.
  Create a feature branch first, or record this repo as having no
  PR workflow with `Dev10x:friction-setup` (supervisor_review:
  none) if it is single-author."
- ❌ If no changes → Error: "No changes to commit"
- ✅ If staged changes exist → Continue
- ⚠️ If only unstaged changes → Ask: "Stage all changes? (y/n)"

### Step 1.5: Detect Branch Drift (GH-147)

**Why this step exists.** Step 1's base-branch block catches HEAD
on `develop`/`main`/`master`, but the no-PR-workflow escape
disables that block, and any *other* non-base branch passes
silently. In long sessions a `rebase --continue`, a forgotten
`git checkout`, or a script can move HEAD to a different feature
branch (or back to develop where the escape applies) unnoticed.
The commit then lands on the wrong branch and recovery requires
reflog archaeology.

**Source the expected ticket from plan-sync context:**

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__plan_sync_json_summary()
```

Read `plan.context.tickets` from the response. If the call returns
an empty dict, the `tickets` list is missing, or the list is
empty, **skip this step entirely** — no orchestrator is tracking
expected work, so drift cannot be detected. This preserves
backward compatibility for ad-hoc `/Dev10x:git-commit`
invocations outside `Dev10x:work-on`.

**Compare against current HEAD:**

```bash
git symbolic-ref --short HEAD
```

For each ticket ID in `context.tickets`, check whether the
branch name contains it as a `/`-delimited segment (avoid
substring false positives — `GH-14` must not match a branch
containing `GH-147`). Match passes when ANY expected ticket is
present.

**On match → continue to Step 2 silently.**

**On mismatch → drift detected.** Fire the decision gate:

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text,
call spec: [ask-branch-drift.md](./tool-calls/ask-branch-drift.md)).
This gate is `ALWAYS_ASK` — it fires at every friction level
including `adaptive`, because auto-selecting either branch
silently masks the drift the gate exists to catch.

Substitute the placeholders in the call spec:
- `<actual-branch>` — output of `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`
- `<expected-ticket>` — first ticket from `context.tickets`
- `<expected-branch>` — most recent `checkout: moving to <name>`
  entry in `git reflog -n 50` whose target contains the expected
  ticket ID; fall back to `<user>/<expected-ticket>/...` if no
  reflog entry matches

**Verify expected branch exists before offering the switch option
(GH-462 F5):** Before constructing the gate options, run:

```bash
git rev-parse --verify <expected-branch>
```

- If the command exits **0** (branch exists locally or as a
  remote ref), include the "Switch back to expected branch"
  option as documented.
- If the command exits **non-zero** (branch no longer exists —
  e.g., deleted after merge), the switch option would fail with
  `pathspec did not match`. Instead, replace it with:
  - **Archive stale plan** — call `plan_sync_archive()` to
    clear the obsolete `in_progress` plan, then continue on
    the current branch. Present this as the recommended option
    with description "The expected branch was deleted (likely
    merged). Archive the stale plan and commit here."

**Handling the user's choice:**

- **Switch back to expected branch** — run `git checkout
  <expected-branch>` and stop the skill. The orchestrator (or
  user) re-invokes `Dev10x:git-commit` after the checkout. Do
  NOT auto-resume — the working tree state on the expected
  branch may differ and Step 1's status check must re-run.
- **Archive stale plan** (shown instead of switch when branch
  is gone) — call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__plan_sync_archive()`
  and proceed to Step 2 on the current branch.
- **Continue on current branch** — proceed to Step 2. The
  ticket ID extracted in Step 2 will reflect the actual branch,
  not the expected one. This is the intentional-switch path.
- **Abort** — stop the skill without changing branches.

**Nested-mode behavior.** Unattended mode does NOT bypass this
gate. The orchestrator's plan approval covers *what* to commit,
not *where*; a wrong-branch commit is a higher-severity error
than the friction this gate adds. Treat the gate as a safety
interlock that fires even when every other prompt is auto-advanced.

### Step 2: Extract Ticket ID from Branch

**Branch naming convention:** `username/TICKET-ID/[worktree-name/]description`

**Examples:**
- `janusz/PAY-133/fix-motor-timeout` → `PAY-133`
- `janusz/ENG-42/add-retry-mechanism` → `ENG-42`
- `janusz/PAY-133/app-pos-7/fix-motor-timeout` → `PAY-133` (worktree)

**Extraction:**
```bash
# Extract ticket ID (second segment)
TICKET_ID=$(git branch --show-current | cut -d'/' -f2)

# Validate format (TEAM-NUMBER)
if [[ ! $TICKET_ID =~ ^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "⚠️  Warning: Could not extract ticket ID from branch name"
  echo "Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
  echo "Expected format: username/TICKET-ID/[worktree/]description"
fi
```

**If extraction fails:**
- Ask user: "What is the ticket ID? (e.g., PAY-133)"
- Use provided ticket ID

**If no ticket (technical branch):**
- Commits without ticket reference are allowed
- Skip ticket prompts

### Step 2.5: Optional JTBD Title Derivation

This step activates when **any** of these conditions are met:
- **Explicit request:** User passes "use Dev10x:jtbd" (or similar) in `/Dev10x:git-commit` args
- **First commit:** Ticket ID extracted, zero commits ahead of develop, and
  commit type is Feature (✨) or Bug (🐛)

**Flow:**
1. Invoke the `Dev10x:jtbd` base skill in **unattended** mode with `ticket_id`.
   The returned story carries one ROI bucket and an evidence rank (see
   `Dev10x:jtbd` § Guiding Principle and § Step 1).
2. Derive the title from the **bucket and the shape of the truth**, never by
   transposing the "so [beneficiary] can" clause into an imperative.
   Transposing a fixed-shape clause yields a fixed-shape title; a release of
   17 PRs derived that way read `Let <actor> <verb>` eleven times (GH-1225).
   The same rules govern PR titles — `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` § Title Frames
   names four PR-title frames (Outcome, Prevention, Actor, Subject); they
   map onto the shape table below, and the Actor frame is only available
   for a human role.
3. Run the title checks below, then present two candidates in different
   frames plus "type your own":
   ```
   Suggested titles (bucket: Revenue — leak):
     1. Bill every service the customer agreed to
     2. Stop approved work vanishing from the order total
   Accept 1 or 2, or type your own
   ```
4. If the user accepts → use it as the commit title description (Step 4 is
   pre-filled). If the user types their own → use that; when it names a
   different job than the story did, feed the correction back to the story.

**Frame follows the shape of the truth, not the bucket.** The bucket says
where the money is; the frame says what kind of change the diff is.
Pick the bucket first, then the shape, then a frame from that row.
Evidence: one repair-shop POS release of 17 PRs re-titled (GH-1225).

| Shape of the truth | Frames | Example |
|---|---|---|
| New value the actor could not get before | `Collect`, `Bill`, `Capture <revenue event>`, `Unblock <sale>`, `Get <actor> to <milestone> sooner` | `Collect tips on terminals and pay-by-link, per store` |
| Money or agreed work leaking away | `Bill every <agreed thing>`, `Stop <leak>` | `Bill every service the customer agreed to` |
| Preventing a failure or a cost | `Prevent <failure>`, `Keep <invariant>`, `Spare <actor> <penalty>` | `Spare a shop a state fine for a missing odometer` |
| Manual step or wait removed | `Drop <manual step>`, `Cut <wait>` | `Drop the staff approval from every settings edit` |
| Owner's choice or discipline made available | `Choose <trade-off>`, `Prove <thing> before <check>` | `Prove each wheel's pressure before a spot inspection` |
| Contract held with a named counterparty | `Hold <contract> with <counterparty>` | `Hold the POS tipping schema in generated types` |

Same bucket, different shape: `Prevent stale plans from reaching new
worktrees` is Cost money in a prevention sentence, and it is the right title.
`Cut <effort>` on that change would have billed a saving nobody measured.

**Title checks (run before presenting):**

- **Human first.** The subject or object names a role: shop, owner,
  technician, support rep, customer. "the CRM", "the client", "the poller",
  "the API" are mechanisms. When the only honest actor is a system, the PR is
  plumbing — apply the generated-only rule below instead of hunting for a
  human.
- **Generated-only rule.** A diff that is entirely machine output (codegen,
  lockfiles, schema regen) takes `Hold <contract> with <counterparty>`, bucket
  Platform integrity, `👽`, no `Fixes:`. Never an outcome title: it either
  repeats the sibling PR's win on the release list or claims a step the diff
  does not deliver. The ticket-level outcome goes on the PR that wires it.
- **`Hold` needs a counterparty.** Finish "the contract we hold is with
  ___" (the POS service, the backend gateway, the rollout plan). If nothing outside
  this repo relies on the change, it is Cost, not Platform integrity.
  A watcher script that slept is Cost; the types it watches are integrity.
- **No undelivered invariant.** If the PR body names an open ticket that
  undermines the claim, `Keep <invariant>` is unavailable.
- **"and" is a split signal.** Two buckets or two beneficiaries in one title
  means two PRs. If already merged, title by the part with the hardest number
  and carry the other in the body.
- **Second meaning check.** Read each candidate once in the feature's own
  domain. `Capture` on a change that records an approval reads as
  capture-as-record; `Cut staff` on an employee-deactivation feature reads as
  firing. Force the money word into the line or pick another frame.
- **Sibling check.** When the ticket has other PRs, titles differ by
  outcome, not by verb. `look up` vs `create` is not a distinction; a support
  rep on a call vs an owner self-serving is.
- **Incumbent paraphrase.** A candidate that restates the current title
  almost verbatim is not an alternative; produce a second frame.
- **Specific and general.** Offer one candidate naming the entities (channels,
  states, roles) and one without. Pick the specific one when the names matter
  to a business reader, the general one when the specific reads technical:
  `Collect tips on terminals and pay-by-link, per store` vs
  `Earn tips wherever a store takes payment`.
- **Release-list bullseye.** Release notes are read by the business. Read the
  title next to its siblings from the same release; a non-engineer must be
  able to say what real-world use case each one serves and which carry
  deployment risk. When a supervisor rewrites a suggested title, the
  rewrite names the job the AI missed: keep the rewrite, and record the miss.

**Skip entirely** when not explicitly requested AND it's a subsequent commit,
refactor, test, docs, or config change — keeping those fast. Also skip when a
Job Story was already sourced from the Linear ticket earlier in this session
(e.g., during `ticket:work-on`) — invoking the `jtbd` skill again is redundant.

### Step 3: Determine Commit Type

**Project override check:** Before presenting the type menu,
check for a strategy override:

1. Read `<Dev10x config>/gitmoji.yaml`
2. Get the repo's `org/repo`: `git remote get-url origin`, then
   take the last two path segments — the same pair for an SSH or
   an HTTPS remote (ADR-0026). No `origin` remote → the `projects`
   list is not evaluated; skip to step 4.
3. Walk the `projects` list — first `match_repo` glob that fits
   `org/repo` selects the named `strategy` (`match:` is read as a
   deprecated alias for one release)
4. If no match, check `default-strategy`
5. If still no match, check for a semantic-release config in
   the project root (see `references/semantic-release.md`).
   Search for `release.config.mjs`, `.releaserc.json`,
   `.releaserc.yaml`, or `package.json` with a `"release"` key.
   If found, extract `releaseRules` from the
   `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer` plugin config and enrich
   the defaults with `release` tags. This adds release impact
   metadata without replacing the type menu.
6. If no config found, load `references/gitmoji-defaults.yaml`

If the user config or semantic-release config is invalid or
unreadable, log a warning and fall back to the defaults file —
never block the commit.

When a strategy is resolved (from manual override, semantic-release
auto-detection, or defaults), use its `gitmoji-mapping` list.
Each entry has `emoji`, `label`, `description`, and optional
`release` (patch/minor/major/none). When `release` is present,
append it as a badge: `"Bug fixes [patch]"`.

See `references/project-override.md` for manual override schema.
See `references/semantic-release.md` for auto-detection details.

**Unattended mode:** Auto-select the commit type from context
(e.g., changed file types, session history, orchestrator hints).
Skip the interactive prompt entirely. Use `label` matching
against detected change type. If a project override is loaded,
match against its entries.

**Attended mode — ask user to select commit type:**

Build the `AskUserQuestion` options from the loaded mapping
(project override or defaults). Present the first 4 entries
as options. If more exist, mention them in the question text
as additional choices available via "Other".

**Default gitmoji mapping:** Loaded from
`references/gitmoji-defaults.yaml` (ships with the plugin).
The "Other" option is always appended to allow custom gitmoji.

### Step 4: Get Commit Description

**Unattended mode:** Auto-generate the description from session
context (ticket title, changed files, commit type). Apply JTBD
self-check automatically and proceed without prompting.

**Attended mode — ask user:**
```
Short description (will be title line):
[User types description]
```

**Validate:**
- Calculate total length: `gitmoji + space + TICKET-ID + space + description`
- If > 72 chars → Ask: "Title is {X} characters (max 72). Please shorten the description."
- Iterate until ≤ 72 chars

**JTBD self-check (mandatory):** Before accepting the description, verify it
describes the **user-facing outcome**, not the implementation action. No hook
enforces this today — the only commit-msg hook checks fixup links — so this
self-check is the gate.

| Blocked verb | Example bad title | JTBD rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| Add | "Add retry logic" | "Enable automatic retry on failure" |
| Update | "Update OAuth scopes" | "Enable terminal discovery" |
| Remove | "Remove dead code" | "Simplify payment flow" |
| Refactor | "Refactor repository" | "Simplify repository hierarchy" |
| Move/Rename | "Move factory to utils" | "Enable shared factory access" |
| Synchronize | "Sync skill with source" | "Enable dual-mode workflow" |

If the description starts with an implementation verb, rewrite it before
proceeding. The verb list is a denylist, not a recipe: `Let`, `Enable`,
`Allow`, `Support`, `Ensure` all pass it and all produce capability-grant
titles ("Let a shop find the tip setting") that read as feature inventory.
An outcome is a changed behaviour or metric, not a granted capability.
Pick the frame from the shape-of-the-truth table in Step 2.5 instead.

**Example titles:**
- `✅ PAY-310 Stabilize tax amount tests` (38 chars)
- `🐛 PROJ-404 Bill every service the customer agreed to` (52 chars)
- `✨ PROJ-248 Collect tips on terminals and pay-by-link, per store` (63 chars)
- `👽 PROJ-248 Hold the POS tipping schema in generated types` (57 chars)

### Step 4.5: Revert and Re-land Titles

GitHub's default revert subject fails every rule here: on GH-1225's release
it was 83 chars, nested two `Revert "` prefixes, carried a key from a
tracker the release pipeline cannot resolve, and named no outcome.
Never let `Revert "…"` become a commit subject.

| Kind | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Revert | `⏪ <REVERT-TICKET> <effect on the user, for now>` | `⏪ PROJ-727 Send roster changes back through support for now` |
| Re-land | `⏩ <FEATURE-TICKET> Reland <noun-phrase outcome>` | `⏩ PROJ-725 Reland self-serve roster changes, no support ticket` |

- The marker sits right after the ticket ID: the gitmoji slot is taken, and a
  trailing `(re-land)` is the first thing a 72-char trim eats.
- After `Reland` the outcome is a noun phrase inherited from the original
  title's frame, not a fresh imperative.
- Only the original carries the plain outcome; the revert and re-land carry a
  direction marker so a release list never shows the same capability twice
  with no way to tell which entry is live.
- The revert carries its own ticket (create one), the re-land the feature
  ticket, so both close in the release pipeline.
- A revert body must state: the observed failure and where it was seen, what
  must be true before re-landing, the reverted SHA and original PR, and
  `Fixes:` its own ticket. "Reverts #N" alone is not a body.

### Step 5: Get Problem Explanation

**If the problem and solution are already known from prior context** in the
session (e.g., from a preceding scope, code review, or ticket investigation),
auto-generate Steps 5-6 rather than asking redundant questions.

**Attended mode:** Present the pre-filled content in the preview
(Step 9) for user review.

**Unattended mode:** Auto-generate and proceed directly to
staging and commit — no preview gate.

**Otherwise, ask user:**
```
Detailed explanation of the problem being solved:
(What was wrong? Why did it need fixing? Context?)

[User provides explanation - can be multiple lines]
```

**Guidance:**
- Explain WHAT was wrong
- Explain WHY it needed fixing
- Provide context
- 2-4 sentences typically sufficient

**Example:**
```
Tests in TestAddTireServiceIndividual and TestAddTireServiceMultiple
were marked as flaky because they randomly failed when tax amounts
or percentages were generated as zero by Faker.
```

### Step 6: Get Solution Points

**Unattended mode:** Auto-generate solution points from the
staged diff and session context. Summarize what changed in
2-4 bullet points without prompting.

**Attended mode — ask user:**
```
Solution points (what did you change?):
Enter each point on a new line. Type 'done' when finished.

1: [User enters first point]
2: [User enters second point]
3: [User enters third point]
done
```

**Format each point:**
- Start with `-` (bullet point)
- Be specific about what changed
- Include file names if relevant

**Example:**
```
- Added non_zero trait to MoneyFaker with min_value=Decimal('0.01')
- Updated test fixtures to ensure tax amounts and percentages >= 0.01
- Removed @pytest.mark.flaky decorators
```

### Step 7: Generate Complete Commit Message

**Title format:** If a project override defines `title-format`,
use it to assemble the title line. Supported placeholders:
- `<gitmoji>` — emoji from selected type
- `<ticket>` — extracted ticket ID
- `<description>` — user-provided description
- `<conventional-type>` — label from mapping, lowercased

Default format: `<gitmoji> <ticket> <description>`

**Assemble message:**
```
<title per format>

<problem explanation>

Solution:
<solution points>

Fixes: <TICKET-ID>
```

**Example:**

✅ PAY-310 Fix flaky tests with non-zero tax amounts

Tests in TestAddTireServiceIndividual and TestAddTireServiceMultiple
were marked as flaky because they randomly failed when tax amounts
or percentages were generated as zero by Faker.

Solution:
- Added non_zero trait to MoneyFaker with min_value=Decimal('0.01')
- Updated test fixtures to ensure tax amounts and percentages >= 0.01
- Removed @pytest.mark.flaky decorators

Fixes: PAY-310
```

### Step 8: Validate Line Lengths (72 char limit)

**IMPORTANT:** Before showing preview, validate ALL lines are ≤ 72 characters.

**Validation command:**
```bash
# Check each line of the commit message
echo "$COMMIT_MESSAGE" | awk '
  length > 72 {
    print "❌ Line " NR " too long (" length " chars): " $0
    fail = 1
  }
  END { exit fail }
'
```

**If any line exceeds 72 characters:**

**Unattended mode:** Auto-wrap or shorten the offending lines
(split long bullets, abbreviate paths, use shorter synonyms).
Re-validate and proceed without prompting. If auto-fix is not
possible, surface the error back to the orchestrator.

**Attended mode:**
1. Show which line(s) are too long with character count
2. Ask user to shorten the offending line(s)
3. Re-validate until all lines pass

**Quick length check for a single line:**
```bash
echo "your line here" | awk '{print length " chars"}'
```

**Common fixes for long lines:**
- Split into multiple bullet points
- Use shorter synonyms
- Move details to next line
- Abbreviate file paths (just filename, not full path)

**Example validation output:**
```
❌ Line 7 too long (77 chars): - Rename stages: base-os → system-base, base-python → python-dependencies

Suggestion: Split into two lines or shorten:
- Rename stages for clarity (system-base, python-dependencies)
```

### Step 9: Resolve Preview Gate and Confirm

**REQUIRED (ADR-0016, GH-757):** Call
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="artifact_preview",
context={})` before deciding whether to show the preview.
Do NOT branch on unattended/attended mode, `friction_level`, or
`active_modes` for this step — the resolver reads session
policy (including the solo-maintainer overlay) itself.

1. `effect == "ask"` → Display the formatted message below and
   fire the EXISTING `AskUserQuestion` widget (call spec:
   [ask-message-preview.md](./tool-calls/ask-message-preview.md)).
   **This step is MANDATORY when the effect is `ask` — DO NOT
   proceed to `git commit` without user approval; skipping the
   widget in that case is a compliance violation.**
2. `effect == "auto-advance"` → Skip the interactive prompt and
   proceed directly to staging (Step 10) and commit creation
   (Step 11) using the recommended option (create the commit as
   shown). Surface the returned `record` line in the transcript.
3. `effect == "skip"` → Skip the preview step entirely (no
   display, no widget) and proceed directly to Step 10.
4. Response has an `error` key → fail safe: treat as `ask` —
   display the preview and fire the widget.

**Display formatted message** (when effect is `ask`):
```
Preview of commit message:
─────────────────────────────────
<formatted message>
─────────────────────────────────

Create this commit? (y/n/edit)
- y: Create commit
- n: Cancel
- edit: Modify the message
```

**If edit:**
- Ask which part to edit (title/explanation/solution)
- Re-prompt for that section
- Show new preview

### Step 9.5: Pre-format Python files (GH-224)

When the change set includes `*.py` files, pre-format them
**before staging** so the project's pre-commit hook has nothing
to rewrite. Without this step, Black/isort/ruff inside the hook
reformat staged files, fail the commit, and restore the changes
unstaged — forcing a re-stage + retry loop that fires once per
Python-touching commit.

**Detect Python files in the change set:**

```bash
git diff --name-only -- '*.py'
git diff --cached --name-only -- '*.py'
```

Union of the two lists = files that will end up in this commit
after `git add -A`. If the union is empty, skip this step.

**Choose one formatter path** (in order of preference):

1. **`pre-commit run --files <files>`** — respects whatever the
   project configures (Black, isort, ruff, mypy, etc.).
   Available when `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists at repo root.
2. **`uv run ruff format <files>`** — when ruff is a dev dep and
   the project uses ruff format.
3. **`uv run black <files>` and `uv run isort <files>`** — when
   Black + isort are the configured formatters.

**Fall-through rule:** Formatter invocation must NOT block the
commit. If the chosen formatter is missing, errors, or returns
non-zero, log a one-line note ("pre-format skipped: <reason>")
and continue to Step 10. The pre-commit hook will still run on
`git commit`; the worst case is the original loop, which is no
worse than the pre-GH-224 baseline.

**Unattended mode:** Run the pre-format silently without
prompting. Errors fall through per the rule above. No
`AskUserQuestion` — this is a mechanical preparation step.

### Step 10: Stage Files (if needed)

**Pre-staging gate (GH-157):** If the index already contains
staged files when this skill is invoked (`git diff --cached
--name-only` returns non-empty), the caller may have staged
manually and the staged set is now a hidden boundary the skill
would silently accept.

**Attended mode — REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT
use plain text):
- **Use existing staging (Recommended)** — commit only the
  currently staged files; do not run `git add -A`
- **Unstage and re-select** — run `git restore --staged .` and
  follow the normal staging flow below

**Unattended mode:** Honor pre-existing staging as-is when the
orchestrator explicitly requested partial staging via pathspec;
otherwise log a warning and proceed with `git add -A` on the
union of staged and unstaged changes. Document the decision in
the commit body if it deviates from the staged set.

Audit GH-157 caught a session where manual `git reset HEAD` +
selective `git add` set an irreversible boundary that the skill
inherited without confirmation — remediation required invoking
`Dev10x:git-commit-split` from scratch.

**Hard rule: NEVER stage individual files by name** (e.g.,
`git add file1.py file2.py`) to PICK files into a commit.
Selective staging bypasses the skill contract — all changes
in the working directory belong to this commit. Use
`git add -A` or `git add .` as the staging primitive.

**Escape valve — excluding unrelated paths.** When the working
tree contains changes that genuinely do not belong in this
commit (e.g., a session-scoped config touch in `.claude/`
captured incidentally while editing `skills/`), prefer **one of**
the following over selective `git add`:

1. **Commit the unrelated paths first.** Re-invoke
   `Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)` for the unrelated change with
   its own message, then return to this commit with a clean
   working tree. This is the default — keep commits atomic by
   *time*, not by `git add` argument lists.
2. **Pathspec exclusion.** When unrelated paths cannot be
   committed first (e.g., generated noise that should stay
   out of the commit altogether), pass an exclude pathspec
   to `git add` so the staging primitive remains the same:
   ```bash
   git add -A -- ':!path/to/excluded' ':!other/path'
   ```
   This is NOT selective staging — it stages everything except
   the named paths and is allowed by the contract.
3. **Post-add unstage** (last resort). After `git add -A`,
   remove specific paths from the index with
   `git restore --staged <pathspec>`. Document in the commit
   message body why those paths were excluded so the rationale
   is preserved.

Never use `git reset HEAD <path>` or `git rm --cached <path>`
as exclusion shortcuts — they create the same selective-staging
anti-pattern the hard rule prohibits.

**Unattended mode:** Auto-stage all changes (`git add -A`)
without prompting. The orchestrator's approved plan implies
all current changes are intended for this commit. If the
orchestrator wants to exclude paths, it MUST pass them via
the pathspec-exclusion form above — the unattended default
does not silently drop files.

**Attended mode — if unstaged changes exist:**

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).
Options:
- Stage all (Recommended) — `git add -A`
- Only commit already staged files
- Abort

### Step 11: Create the Commit

**Use Write tool + `-F` to preserve formatting (hookify blocks heredocs):**

1. **REQUIRED:** Create a temp file via mktmp MCP tool:
   `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp(namespace='git',
   prefix='commit-msg', ext='.txt')`
   Store the returned `path` value.
   **Fallback** (if MCP unavailable):
   ```bash
   /tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh git commit-msg .txt
   ```
   **Do NOT use hardcoded paths** — hooks reject non-mktmp
   paths and the commit will fail.

2. **Read the empty file first** — the Write tool requires a prior Read
   on the same path. Call `Read(<unique-path>)` before writing. The file
   will be empty (mktmp creates it); this is expected.

3. Write the commit message to that file using the Write tool:
   ```
   Write <unique-path>:
   <gitmoji> <TICKET-ID> <description>

   <problem explanation>

   Solution:
   <solution point 1>
   <solution point 2>
   <solution point 3>

   Fixes: <TICKET-ID>
   ```

4. Create the commit from the file:
   ```bash
   git commit -F <unique-path>
   ```

**Verify success:**
```bash
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ Commit created successfully"
  git log -1 --oneline
else
  echo "❌ Commit failed"
  # Show error
fi
```

**Error recovery:** If the hook blocks the commit, you are
likely using a non-mktmp path or running outside the skill
context. Restart via `Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)` with no args.
Do NOT attempt to bypass hooks with `python3 subprocess` or
`--no-verify`.

### Step 12: Next Steps

**Unattended mode:** Return control to the orchestrator
immediately after a successful commit. Do not show next-step
options or ask "what next?".

**Attended mode — ask user:**
```
Commit created successfully!

Next steps:
1. Continue working
2. Create another commit
3. Create PR (/Dev10x:gh-pr-create)

What would you like to do? (1/2/3/done)
```

**If 3 (Create PR):**
- Use `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` skill
- PR title will use this commit message

## Important Notes

- **No Co-Authoring:** Never add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" footer (per CLAUDE.md)
- **72 char limit:** ALL lines strictly enforced (title AND body)
- **Always validate:** Run `echo "line" | awk '{print length}'` before committing
- **Ticket extraction:** Automatic from branch name
- **Gitmoji format:** Use emoji character, not :code:
- **Footer:** Always include `Fixes: TICKET-ID`
- **Spacing:** One space after gitmoji, one space after ticket ID
- **Never `git -C <path>`**: See Step 1 — use `cd` to repo root instead.
- **Never `cd /path && git ...`**: The `&&` shifts the command prefix,
  breaking allow-rule matching. Use a standalone `cd` call or absolute
  paths. Each Bash call must contain exactly one command.
- **Never chain `git add && git commit`**: Use two separate Bash tool
  calls — one to stage, one to commit. Same rule applies to
  `git add && git rebase --continue`. Each call must stand alone.
- **Never stage individual files**: Use `git add -A` or `git add .`
  exclusively. Selective staging bypasses the skill contract.
- **Mandatory mktmp usage**: ALL temp files for commit messages
  MUST be created via mktmp (MCP tool or script fallback).
  Hardcoded paths are rejected by hooks and cause commit failure.

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios

**"Not in a git repository":**
- Error and stop
- Suggest: Initialize git repo first

**"No changes to commit":**
- Show: `git status`
- Suggest: Make changes first

**"Cannot commit to develop/main/master":**
- Error and stop
- Suggest: Create feature branch first, or record the repo as
  having no PR workflow via `Dev10x:friction-setup`
  (`supervisor_review: none`) for single-author repos (GH-57)

**"Title too long":**
- Show character count
- Ask for shorter description
- Iterate until ≤ 72

**"Pre-commit hook failed":**
- Show hook error
- Ask: "Fix issues and retry? (y/n)"
- If yes: Return to Step 9 (stage files)

**"Commit failed":**
- Show git error
- Suggest common fixes (conflicts, permissions, etc.)
