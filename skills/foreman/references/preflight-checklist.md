# Phase 0.4 — Permission pre-flight detail

The full command-shape enumeration behind Phase 0.4 of
`instructions.md`. Read this before running pre-flight on a new
night-shift; the numbered list in `instructions.md` names the six
checks, this file carries the exact invocations and field evidence.

## 1. Resolve the CLI shape once, and reuse it

`dev10x foreman probe --scratchpad <run-dir>` proves the watcher CLI
runs unprompted and the quota/base/heartbeat reads work. **Resolve the
CLI shape here and record it in the manifest** — the bare `dev10x`
entry point exists only when the CLI is installed as a uv tool. Probe
once with the bare shape; on a 127 exit fall back in this order, and
use whichever answers for `watch` in Phase 1 too:

| Install shape | Working invocation |
|---|---|
| `dev10x` installed as a uv tool | `dev10x foreman probe …` |
| CWD is a plugin-repo checkout | `uv run dev10x foreman probe …` (GH-947) |
| Normal plugin-cache install, CWD is the target repo | `uv run --project $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT dev10x foreman probe …` (GH-961) |

The third row is the common case for a night run: the plugin lives
under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<owner>/<plugin>/<version>` while the
CWD is the repo being worked, so `uv run` alone resolves the wrong
project and the bare command exits 127. Two consecutive night runs
burned pre-flight window rediscovering this. Discovering it while
arming the watcher costs the night; discovering it now costs one
command.

## 2. One representative MCP call per wrapper

One call per MCP wrapper the crew will need (`ci_check_status`,
`issue_get`, `pr_get`, …) proves the MCP server is up and the tools
resolve before any worker depends on them.

**A green verdict is not a failure diagnosis (GH-1062).** Proving
`ci_check_status` proves only that a worker can learn a check *failed*
— not that it can read *why*. Prove the failing-log shape too, on any
recent red run in this repo:

```
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

(or `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/jobs/<job-id>/logs`). Record
whichever answers in the manifest and in the crew prompt's verified
tool shapes. In the 2026-08-23 run a check went red mid-night, the
corrective brief improvised this shape unproven, and the worker
silent-wedged on the resulting prompt for ~3h — found only by
heartbeat stall plus mtime forensics. The verdict tool was proven; the
follow-up was not, and the follow-up is what the night needed.

## 3. The subagent tool surface — and its git shapes

Spawn a throwaway probe subagent that runs the crew template's
`ToolSearch` select-query and then one read-only MCP call. The
watchdog's own surface proves nothing about a worker's: subagents get
MCP wrappers only as deferred tools and get no `Skill(...)` at all. If
the probe comes back empty, narrow the worker contract in the
manifest rather than letting workers improvise raw CLI
(`tool-surface.md`).

**Spawn the probe at crew depth — through the foreman, not from here
(GH-1214 finding 2).** A probe this session spawns is depth 1; a crew
worker is spawned by the foreman overseer, at depth 2. Those are not
the same surface, and one run passed this checklist 12 of 12 while the
foreman and every worker had no `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__*` at all.

So spawn the overseer FIRST, have it spawn the probe, and have the
result travel back up — then repeat the two read-only calls from the
overseer itself, since an overseer that cannot reach `issue_get` cannot
relay whatever its workers can do. Record both surfaces in the manifest
separately. An empty result at either depth selects the narrow contract:
[`mcp-connectivity.md`](mcp-connectivity.md) § Absent from spawn.

**In the same probe, run the crew template's CWD mode self-test and
the git shape that mode implies** (GH-1030, GH-1050):

```
cd <one of tonight's worktree paths>      # separate Bash call
pwd                                       # separate Bash call
git status --short                        # Mode P: pwd matched
git -C <that worktree path> status --short  # Mode C: pwd did not
```

Probe the shape the mode actually calls for — the *other* one proves
nothing, and in Mode P a `git -C` whose path equals CWD is denied as
redundant, so a green `-C` probe can even mean the reverse of what it
looks like. Record the probe's mode in the manifest; a crew worker may
land in a different one (depth differs), which is why the worker runs
the self-test itself rather than inheriting this answer.

MCP wrappers and test tools were already proven here; worker-side
*git* was not — and git is what workers run most. In the 2026-08-04/05
run the probe came back fully green and two workers still wedged
later, on `git --git-dir=…` permission prompts that were unanswerable
overnight, invisible in hook logs (a pending prompt records neither a
block nor a denial), and detectable only via heartbeat stall.

A prompt fired **here** surfaces while the supervisor is still present
— the entire point of the one-time window — and the remedy is a narrow
allow rule for the worktree root (e.g. `Bash(git -C <worktrees-root>/*)`)
rather than a night lost to forensics. Cost: one extra command in an
already-mandatory probe.

Probe the shape the mode calls for, not a convenient substitute: a
bare `git status` proves nothing about `git -C`, because the two match
different allow rules. If tonight's chunks will also fetch, rebase, or
stash, the same reasoning extends to those verbs — one read-only
`status --short` in the proven spelling is the floor, not the ceiling.

**Include the worktree-cleanup verbs (GH-1068 F2).** `git -C <wt>
restore` and `git -C <wt> clean` are not chunk work, so they are easy
to leave out of an enumeration built from the queue — and they are
exactly what the watchdog reaches for when it recovers a wedged or
dirty worktree at 03:00. A run froze 7.5 hours on that prompt. Any
verb the *recovery* paths need
([`worktree-recovery.md`](worktree-recovery.md),
[`corrupted-worktree-repair.md`](corrupted-worktree-repair.md)) belongs
in this probe alongside the verbs the chunks need.

## 4. Per-domain test tools — and the install that precedes them

The per-domain test tools for THIS repo (e.g. `run_node_tests`,
`uv run --directory <api> pytest`) — proves the exact invocation
shape and records it for the crew prompt (§ crew template).

**Prove the dependency-install shape for tonight's fresh worktrees
(GH-1062).** A fresh worktree has no `node_modules` / no synced venv,
so the first thing a worker runs is an install — and the install shape
is not the test shape. `pnpm --dir <dir> install` fails under corepack
when the project pins an older pnpm (`packageManager: pnpm@9.15.9`);
only the in-directory invocation self-switches to the pinned version.
Probe the exact form tonight's workers will use, and record the
watchdog pre-installing every worktree during Phase 0 as a sanctioned
fallback when no worker-side shape survives the probe.

## 5. Script deliverables, not just test runners (GH-961)

For every queued chunk whose *deliverable* includes an executable
artifact — a `bin/*.sh`, a generated compose file, a CLI entry point
— dry-run THAT artifact's own invocation shape, or add a narrow allow
rule for it, during this window. A worker that modifies a shell
script legitimately needs to execute it to verify the change, and a
manifest that bans "executing repo shell scripts" wholesale as
unproven leaves that worker with no sanctioned path.

Field case: a chunk whose deliverable was
`bin/render-worktree-config.sh` hit a permission prompt mid-night,
then hit a second one from the banned-shape workaround it improvised
(`ENV=x docker compose config 2>&1 | grep -A2 …` — env prefix plus
redirect plus pipe). Record each proven shape in the manifest so the
worker never has to improvise.

## 6. Write access

Write access to the run directory and the repo tree.

## 7. The watchdog's own gate and triage shapes (GH-1058)

Items 1–6 enumerate what the *crew* runs. The watchdog runs commands
too — the merge gate's CI and draft reads, and the stall-triage
forensics — and those were never on this list. In the 2026-08-21/22
run they raised permission prompts mid-night, invisible in the hook
logs for the usual reason (a pending prompt records neither a block nor
a denial), while MCP replacements were already loaded and unused.

Route them to wrappers rather than proving raw shapes, and record the
routing in the manifest:

| Watchdog need | Prefer | Instead of |
|---|---|---|
| CI verdict at the merge gate | `ci_check_status(wait=false)` | `gh pr checks` |
| draft / mergeability / ancestry | `pr_get` | `gh pr view --json …` |
| run-dir state during stall triage | `dev10x foreman probe` | `ls -lt`, `stat`, `git log` |

Where no wrapper exists, dry-run the raw shape here like any other.
The rule is the same one item 3 makes for workers — the watchdog's
surface proves nothing about the crew's, and the crew's proves nothing
about the watchdog's.

## 8. Dry-run the merge gate itself (GH-1051)

Prove the *policy*, not just the commands. Call:

```
resolve_gate(gate="merge", context={})
```

`effect: "auto-advance"` means merges land unattended tonight. Anything
else means the first `MERGE REQUEST` freezes the run on an
`AskUserQuestion` no one is awake to answer — and the `human_review`
floor produces exactly that on a repo whose policy reads
`adaptive + [solo-maintainer, afk]` but carries no explicit
`merge: auto-advance` override (GH-1056).

On a non-`auto-advance` effect, surface it in the Phase 0.3 gate while
the supervisor is still present, with three honest options:

- pin `merge: auto-advance` for this repo via `pin_gate_preset`
- take a one-night standing authorization for tonight's queue
- run `guided + afk` knowingly — merges hold until morning

Phase 0.3's "adaptive + afk — full walk-away, merges included" is a
promise about the *preset*; this check is what makes it a promise about
the *run*.

## Any prompt fired during pre-flight

Fix it NOW: prefer switching to a wrapper/skill; propose a narrow
allow rule only when no wrapper exists. If neither fits, that command
shape is BANNED for the night and the plan must route around it.
