# MCP connectivity loss (GH-1063, GH-1072, GH-1099)

The MCP surface a role proved at start does not hold for that role's
whole life. This file is the single home for what dies, which role it
strands, and what containment is available — `tool-surface.md`
§ "MCP connectivity is not permanent" is the short pointer into it.

## The transport is not ours (GH-1072)

The call chain is:

```
agent → harness MCP client → our stdio server → dev10x wrapper → subprocess
```

What dies is the **first** hop, harness-client ↔ our-stdio-server. Our
"wrapper layer" sits behind that hop, wrapping subprocess calls.

Dev10x implements no timeout, keepalive, or ping on that connection —
`servers/cli_server.py` and `src/dev10x/mcp/` contain no transport
liveness handling at all. The two things that look like it are not:
`session_store.py`'s TTL is session-*storage* expiry, and
`daemon.py`'s `PING`/`PONG` is a UNIX-socket probe for whether the
daemon **process** is up. The ~1800s ceiling quoted throughout these
docs is a number we *stay under*, never one we enforce.

**Therefore "reconnect-on-demand in the wrapper layer" — the fix as
originally specified in GH-1072 and GH-1099 ask 1 — is not
implementable in this repo.** A layer cannot reconnect a transport it
does not own. Both issues hedge toward exactly this branch; the code
puts us on it. What remains in-repo is (a) shrinking the exposure
window, (b) the containment below, and (c) an upstream report against
the harness client with the 60–90min reproduction.

Shrinking the window is real work, not a consolation: the suspected
mechanism is an idle timeout on a connection held across a long
blocking call, and `ci_check_status(wait=true)` is the longest such
call we make. GH-1088 removed an unconditional 60s `initial_wait` paid
even when CI had already finished. That narrows the window; it does
not close it.

## Four failure surfaces, not one

| Surface | Who is stranded | Documented containment |
|---|---|---|
| Surface absent from the first spawn | foreman + every worker | detect at Phase 0.4 with a depth-2 probe; run the narrow contract — see below |
| Worker loses loaded tools after ~60–90min | crew worker | re-run the exact `ToolSearch` select-query ONCE, then report-and-stop |
| Top-level session loses the whole surface | watchdog / foreman | **no self-recovery path** — see below |
| A write drops mid-call and reports nothing | any role | assume it did not land; re-read before depending on it |

### Absent from spawn (GH-1214 finding 2)

The three surfaces below are all *degradation over time* — a role that
had the tools and lost them. The fourth is different in kind: the
foreman subagent and every crew worker never had them at all, for a
whole 27-hour run, while the watchdog session kept all of them
throughout. Worker heartbeat, verbatim: "Dev10x CLI MCP server failed
to connect this session — using documented fallbacks (gh api,
scratchpad env file, uv run pytest, Dev10x:git skill for push)".
Foreman heartbeat: "MCP is still disconnected on my end, retrying
periodically", all night.

Two things make this the most expensive surface of the four:

1. **The retry mitigation does not apply.** Re-running the select-query
   assumes the tools were once reachable. Here there is nothing to
   re-reach, so a worker following the contract correctly still ends up
   with an empty surface and reaches for a fallback.
2. **Every documented fallback is a prompting shape.** `gh api`, raw
   `pytest`, `mktmp.sh` — the shapes the briefs name for exactly this
   case are the ones the hook layer gates. So the absent surface did not
   merely remove convenience; it manufactured ten worker recoveries
   (GH-1214 finding 1), which is what the run actually paid.

**Detection is a Phase 0.4 obligation, and it must be at crew depth.**
The pre-flight probe subagent is spawned by the top-level session
(depth 1); a worker is spawned by the foreman subagent (depth 2). This
run's pre-flight passed 12 of 12 because it measured the watchdog's
surface. Spawn the overseer first and have *it* spawn the probe.

**Containment is the narrow contract**, declared in the manifest before
dispatch rather than improvised per worker: workers implement, commit,
push, and write the PR body to a file in the run directory; the
watchdog opens the PR with `create_pr`, polls CI, and owns the merge
gate; web-lane workers read CI with `gh run view --log-failed` instead
of running tests locally. That is what held once the gap was found by
hand — the cost of finding it at Phase 0.4 is one extra spawn.

### Worker surface loss (GH-1063)

Three independent crew workers in the 2026-08-23 run lost their Dev10x
surface after 60–90+ minutes — `create_pr` and `push_safe` became
unreachable on tools they had already loaded *and already used*. Two
had pushed and lost only the final PR/verify step; the third wedged
pre-PR with a branch on origin and no PR, needing a fresh-spawn
takeover to finish a chunk that was substantively done.

The mitigation is worker-side and cheap, and it works: re-run the
exact select-query once, then report and stop if the tool is still
gone. It is a mitigation, not a fix — it costs a round trip, depends
on the worker following it, and does nothing for a call that fails
mid-operation. It is baked into `crew-prompt-template.md` § 2.

A worker that instead reads "tool not found" as "this operation is
impossible" improvises raw CLI for a gated operation — the exact
failure the surface split exists to prevent.

### Watchdog surface loss — worse, and unrecoverable in-session (GH-1099)

~18h into the 2026-08-29/30 night run, the **top-level** session lost
all 86 `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__*` tools — pre-loaded at session
start, not deferred — with `plugin:Dev10x:cli` listed among
failed-to-connect servers. The drop followed two 5h platform quota
pauses and long idle stretches, consistent with idle-timeout on a
connection held across session pauses.

**The worker-side mitigation does not transfer.** A `ToolSearch`
select-query returned "No matching deferred tools found": the
top-level session's tools were never deferred, so there is no deferred
entry to re-resolve. Recovery required the human running `/mcp`.

That is run-ending under `foreman`, because the watchdog is the only
role allowed to run the merge gate (`merge_pr`, `pr_get`,
`ci_check_status`) and the rule for MCP-unavailable is "STOP and ask
the user". Overnight that means every gate-passed PR queues until
morning — two gate-verified PRs sat blocked that night until the
supervisor happened to be present.

Containment, in the order it was actually used:

1. **Gate READS fall back to sanctioned `gh api`** — reads are
   idempotent and verifiable, so a raw read is a smaller risk than a
   stalled gate. Record the substitution in the manifest.
2. **Merges queue; they do not improvise.** `merge_pr` is a
   state-changing gated operation — never hand-roll `gh pr merge` to
   route around a dead surface.
3. **Ask the supervisor via `AskUserQuestion`** naming the PRs held
   and why, so a present human can run `/mcp` and unblock the queue.

Do not plan a night run on the assumption that the watchdog can
recover its own surface. It cannot.

### Dropped writes are not acknowledged (GH-1099 ask 2)

A worker's connection dropped mid-`push_safe`; the single permitted
`ToolSearch` retry restored the surface. But a **subsequent
`update_pr` call was silently lost** — no error payload, PR body never
updated. The worker caught it only by re-reading the PR afterwards.

This is a correctness bug, not an availability one: state you believe
you changed is unchanged, and nothing told you. It is also
**undetectable from either end by construction** — when the transport
drops mid-call our response is never delivered, so no error can be
produced server-side, and the client cannot distinguish "never
arrived" from "arrived and returned nothing".

So the contract is caller-side and unconditional:

> **A state-changing MCP call is a request, not a receipt. Assume a
> dropped write did NOT land until a read proves it did.**

Applies to every write wrapper — `update_pr`, `create_pr`,
`push_safe`, `pr_ready`, `pr_labels`, `issue_*`, `merge_pr`. Re-read
the field you set, not merely "the object exists":

- `update_pr(body=…)` → `pr_get` and check the body actually changed.
- `create_pr` / `pr_ready` → `pr_get` and check `isDraft`.
- `push_safe` → confirm the remote ref moved to the SHA you pushed.
- `issue_close` → re-read `state`.

This generalizes `tool-surface.md` § Post-condition re-verification,
which covers the same discipline for a narrower trigger (a force-push
silently re-drafting a PR). Same rule, one more reason for it.

## Status

- **In-repo and shipped:** worker `ToolSearch` retry
  (`crew-prompt-template.md` § 2); the GH-1088 fast path narrowing the
  longest blocking call; this file's containment for the watchdog case
  and for dropped writes.
- **Not implementable in-repo:** reconnect-on-demand
  (GH-1072 / GH-1099 ask 1) — the transport is harness-owned.
- **Drafted, not filed (GH-1121 item 1):** the harness-client report
  with the 60–90min reproduction is written up at
  [`docs/memos/gh-1121-upstream-report-draft.md`](../../../docs/memos/gh-1121-upstream-report-draft.md).
  It has **not** been sent anywhere — filing it is outward-facing
  publication and the supervisor's call.
- **Decided (GH-1121 item 2):** a server-side keepalive is worth
  attempting, but only opt-in behind a flag defaulting OFF and paired
  with the soak that can falsify it — the SDK does expose
  `ServerSession.send_ping`, so the blocker is verification, not
  capability. Reasoning and build order in
  [`docs/memos/gh-1121-keepalive-decision.md`](../../../docs/memos/gh-1121-keepalive-decision.md).
- **Still open (GH-1121 item 3):** verify whatever lands against a real
  60–90+ minute cycle. Until then the worker-side `ToolSearch` re-run
  remains the interim answer.
