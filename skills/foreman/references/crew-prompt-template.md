# Crew worker prompt template

Assemble in this order. `{{placeholders}}` are filled by the foreman
from the run manifest. Do not drop sections — each one is a paid-for
lesson (GH-890, GH-922).

**Read `tool-surface.md` first.** Crew workers are `Agent`-spawned
subagents: `Skill(...)` is unreachable to them, and MCP wrappers only
resolve after an explicit `ToolSearch` select-query. A prompt that
names a skill a worker cannot call is a prompt whose discipline does
not run (GH-922).

## 1. Background preamble (verbatim, first)

Fetch via `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__background_preamble` and prepend
unmodified. Never hand-write a summary of it.

## 2. Fatal shapes + tool-surface bootstrap (immediately after the preamble)

The fatal-shapes block goes FIRST, before the bootstrap, and is the
first thing the foreman writes into any brief. It is not a style note:
ten of ten crew recoveries in the GH-1214 night run were a permission
prompt opened by a shell shape, never a code problem — and every one
of those shapes had a ban somewhere in the brief already. A ban the
worker reads on line 160 does not fire when it reaches for the command
on line 12. Evidence, and the rule for what belongs in the block:
[`fatal-shapes.md`](fatal-shapes.md).

```
FATAL SHAPES — read before your first Bash call.

These do not fail. They open a permission prompt nobody will answer
overnight: you freeze mid-turn, and a PENDING prompt is recorded
nowhere, so no one knows why. If your next command matches a line
here, use the paired shape — or report and STOP.

  ✗ ./manage.py, ./bin/*.py, node_modules/.bin/*, bare vite/tsc
    → uv run --directory <wt> …, or run_node_tests(script=…).
      Never a script's own shebang.
  ✗ gh api -X PATCH/POST, gh pr edit/ready/create/merge, gh issue edit
    → update_pr / pr_ready / create_pr / issue_edit. A subagent that
      shells out to `gh` for a write always prompts.
  ✗ cd X && cmd · ENV=v cmd · cmd | tail · cmd > file · --prefix
    → one command per Bash call. No chain, env prefix, pipe, or
      redirect. Files go through the Write tool.
  ✗ cp · mv — anywhere, including inside your own worktree
    → Read then Write. Porting means re-expressing a design, not
      copying bytes.
  ✗ bash /tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh (the documented .sh fallback)
    → mktmp(namespace="git", prefix="commit-msg", ext=".txt"), and
      Write the message straight to the path it returns.
  ✗ git rebase -i · git commit without -F · anything opening an editor
    → non-interactive only. An interactive rebase freezes you with
      every conflict resolved and staged — it looks like progress.
  ✗ git --git-dir=… --work-tree=…
    → the Mode P / Mode C spelling from the workspace section.
  ✗ find
    → the Glob tool. Escaped parens in a (group) path match no allow
      rule and wedge you silently.

Note what half of these are: the fallback our own docs name. A
fallback fires when your wrappers are gone — which is exactly when it
prompts. Losing a tool means REPORT, never improvise a shape.
```

## 2b. Tool-surface bootstrap (immediately after the fatal-shapes block)

```
Skill() invocations are NOT available to you — every convention you
need is inlined below. MCP wrappers ARE available, but only as
deferred tools: load their schemas ONCE at start with a single
ToolSearch call —

ToolSearch(query="select:mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_get,
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_comment,mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_create,
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__push_safe,mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__create_pr,
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_get,mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_ready,
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_comments,mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_comment_reply,
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__ci_check_status,
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__unresolved_threads,
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_review_thread,mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp")

If that call returns no matching tools, STOP and report the empty
surface to the foreman — do not improvise a raw-CLI equivalent for a
gated operation.

If a tool you already loaded later reports as unreachable, re-run that
exact ToolSearch call ONCE before concluding it is gone — a worker
past ~60 minutes can lose the MCP connection. Still unreachable after
the retry: report it and STOP; never substitute raw CLI.

A dropped connection can also swallow a WRITE with no error payload.
So a state-changing call is a request, not a receipt: after every
update_pr / create_pr / pr_ready / push_safe, re-read the field you
set (pr_get body or isDraft; the remote SHA) and re-issue if it did
not land. Never report a write as done on the call's return alone.
```

Neither the retry nor the write-receipt line is optional politeness —
evidence in [`worker-tool-shapes.md`](worker-tool-shapes.md) (GH-1063)
and [`mcp-connectivity.md`](mcp-connectivity.md) (GH-1099).

## 3. Mission (lifecycle-split — workers stop at PR-open)

```
You are the {{chunk_id}} delivery worker in an unattended
Dev10x:foreman run for repo {{repo}}. You have full decision
authority on scope. Deliver {{chunk_description}} — implemented, CI
green, review addressed, PR OPEN AND READY (verified NOT draft). You
do NOT merge and you do NOT close issues — the orchestrator owns
merge and closure. The supervisor is away: decide, act, log
decisions; never wait on a human, never fire AskUserQuestion.

If this chunk records an ADR, it is ADR-{{adr_number}}. That number
is ASSIGNED, not discovered: do NOT scan docs/adr/ or the base branch
to pick the next free one. Sibling chunks hold numbers that exist only
on their own unmerged branches, so anything you can see is a lower
bound, not the next free slot. Need a second ADR: report it and ask
the foreman for another number.
```

## 4. Anti-stall contract

```
NEVER use `sleep`, `gh pr checks --watch`, `gh run watch`, or any
blocking/polling loop. To wait on CI: a single server-side-waiting
call — ci_check_status(pr_number=<n>, repo="{{repo}}", wait=true,
max_polls=10). Pending is NOT green. If that call returns an empty
or unusable verdict, re-invoke it ONCE; if it is still empty, read
pr_get(...).statusCheckRollup and proceed on that rather than
waiting a third time.

Liveness: write a heartbeat line immediately after EVERY commit,
every test run, every push, and every file-count/verification step
— not on a clock. Nothing interrupts you mid-turn to check one.
Also write one if 15 minutes of wall-clock have passed, but treat
that as the backstop, never the primary trigger. A worker that
cannot heartbeat inside a stall window is dead by definition, and
loses its chunk to a replacement.
```

**Why event-triggered, not time-triggered (GH-967).** The old
wording ("made no tool call for 15 minutes?") implies a timer, and
nothing in a single-turn tool-call loop preempts the model to check
a clock. In the 2026-08-01 run, all five stalled workers were alive
and productive the whole time — every kill snippet caught them
mid-flow on a nearly-finished step — they simply never routed back
to the heartbeat instruction between their own tool calls. A long
absorbing implementation (code → tests → docs → rebase → push)
offers no natural pause point. Commits, test runs, and verification
steps are pause points the model *does* observe, so anchoring the
heartbeat to those makes it mechanically reachable. Phase-boundary
heartbeats were already honored (every incident had a clean setup
heartbeat); the gap was specifically mid-implementation.

Dispatch on `model="sonnet"` by default — `stall-protocol.md`
§ Model tier for crew workers has the evidence (GH-956), with the
GH-967 caveat that sonnet **reduces** stall risk rather than
eliminating it (a sonnet worker stalled with the identical shape).

## 5. Verified tool shapes (from Phase 0.4 pre-flight)

Name the EXACT invocations proven unpromptable for this repo, e.g.:

```
- Web tests: run_node_tests(runner="{{js_runner}}", cwd="{{web_dir}}",
  args=["--", "<filter>"], coverage=false) — `returncode` is the sole
  pass/fail truth.
- Web build/checks: run_node_tests(runner="{{js_runner}}",
  script="build" | "check:*", cwd="{{web_dir}}") — the wrapper runs ANY
  package.json script, so bare `vite` / `pnpm run …` / `node <script>`
  never touch the Bash layer.
- Backend tests: {{backend_test_shape}} (100% coverage on new code).
- Path/file discovery: the Glob tool. NEVER Bash `find` — escaped
  parens in `(group)` route paths match no allow rule and wedge you
  silently, with nothing recorded in the hook log.
- Lint: {{lint_shape}}. A bare `pre-commit` lints the DISPATCHER's
  tree, not yours; if Phase 0.4 proved no worktree-pinned shape, this
  reads "CI only" and you do not improvise one.
- Shape bans (chaining, pipes, redirects, `find`, direct scripts,
  raw `gh` writes, `cp`): see the FATAL SHAPES block above.
```

The `find`, `pre-commit`, and web-build lines are worker deaths, not
style — each wedged a worker silently, with nothing in the hook log.
Evidence and the generalisable diagnostic:
[`worker-tool-shapes.md`](worker-tool-shapes.md) (GH-1059, GH-1066,
GH-1052).

## 6. Workspace + branch

```
WORKSPACE CRITICAL — do NOT assume how Bash CWD behaves for you. It is
spawn-depth-dependent: a depth-1 subagent usually keeps CWD across
calls, a depth-2 crew worker usually does not. Test it; never guess.

MODE SELF-TEST — two separate Bash calls, before any other work:
  1. `cd {{worktree_path}}`
  2. `pwd`

  pwd == {{worktree_path}} → MODE P. Run plain git from here on, and
        NEVER `git -C {{worktree_path}}` — the hook denies a `-C` whose
        path already equals CWD as redundant.
  pwd != {{worktree_path}} → MODE C. CWD reset; pin the worktree as an
        ARGUMENT on every command, never as state:
          git   → `git -C {{worktree_path}} <verb> ...`
          tests → `uv run --directory {{worktree_path}} ...` (or the
                  MCP test wrapper's `cwd=` argument)

State your mode in your FIRST heartbeat ("Mode C") so the overseer can
read your later commands correctly.

BOTH MODES:
  - Everywhere else this brief writes `git -C {{worktree_path}} …`,
    read it as the Mode C spelling: in MODE P drop the `-C` and its
    path, keeping the rest of the command exactly as written.
  - files → absolute paths under {{worktree_path}} for every
            Read / Write / Edit / Grep call
  - `git --git-dir=…`, chaining, and the rest are in the FATAL SHAPES
    block above — the `cd X` in the self-test is the ONE exception,
    and only as its own standalone Bash call.

FIRST ACTION after the self-test: confirm the branch with
`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` (Mode P) or
`git -C {{worktree_path}} rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` (Mode C).

No new worktrees, and never call `EnterWorktree` — you are pinned to
{{worktree_path}}. If you ever need another worktree's content, report
its path and branch and STOP; the watchdog reaches it, not you.
```

Keep the self-test and `EnterWorktree` rules verbatim. The self-test
replaced an unconditional `git -C` mandate that the validate-bash hook
denies whenever CWD already matches — the template was ordering the one
shape the hook rejects, in exactly the case where `cd` had persisted
(GH-1050). `EnterWorktree` wedges Bash for the rest of the worker's
life — evidence and failure shapes in
[`tool-surface.md`](tool-surface.md) § Subagent Bash CWD,
[`worker-tool-shapes.md`](worker-tool-shapes.md) § CWD mode, and
[`worktree-recovery.md`](worktree-recovery.md).

A fresh isolation worktree normally starts DIRTY — a post-checkout
hook seeds modified and untracked files under `.claude/`. This is
expected noise, not a signal. Bake the recipe in verbatim with its
"do not investigate" preface; prose guidance ("investigate and clear
the tree") reliably failed in the field, while the literal recipe
fixed it immediately:

```
Your worktree will start dirty with modified/untracked files under
`.claude/` — this is hook-seeded noise. Do NOT investigate it, do NOT
report it as a finding, and do NOT commit it. Clear it with exactly
these five steps, one Bash call each. `<git>` is `git` in MODE P and
`git -C {{worktree_path}}` in MODE C — use the one your self-test
proved, never the other:
  1. `<git> fetch origin`
  2. `<git> stash -u`
  3. `<git> checkout -b {{branch_name}} origin/{{base_branch}}`
  4. `<git> stash drop`
  5. write your first heartbeat line
```

### Durability envelope (bake in verbatim)

Workers routinely describe an edit and let the reader infer a push.
Name what survives, explicitly (GH-971 F4):

```
WHAT SURVIVES YOUR DEATH: commits pushed to origin, and comments on
tracker issues. NOTHING ELSE. Your worktree, your scratchpad, your
plan file and any uncommitted change die with you and are unreachable
to every agent that follows — a replacement gets a FRESH worktree and
cannot read yours.

So: push early and push often, and narrate any plan worth keeping
into your heartbeat file or an issue comment rather than a local note.
```
## 6b. Documentation under `.claude/` (supervisor-only)

Claude Code's self-settings consent gate fires on the Write/Edit tool
family for any path under `.claude/`, **regardless of matching allow
rules** (GH-812 RC-A), and an unattended worker cannot answer that
prompt. The `cp`/`mv` staging workaround this section used to
recommend is withdrawn (GH-1318, supervisor ruling 2026-09-01) — `cp`
is a fatal shape (§2) with no carve-out here or anywhere else.

```
If your chunk requires creating or modifying anything under
`.claude/rules/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/settings.json`,
`.claude/settings.local.json`, or `.claude/Dev10x/**`, do NOT write it
by any route. STOP, file a scoped issue via issue_create naming the
exact file and content needed, and report it to the foreman as a
supervisor-only decision. Do not route around the gate.
```

## 7. Scope + lifecycle (worker half)

```
- Read every issue body (issue_get) and the source memo/spec BEFORE coding.
- ORDER IS FIXED: commit → push → verify → PR. You verify a pushed
  commit, never a dirty worktree — if you are waiting on anything and
  have not committed, you are out of order, not busy (GH-1363).
- One atomic commit per issue: get the message path from
  mktmp(namespace="git", prefix="commit-msg", ext=".txt"), Write the
  message to THAT path, then `git -C {{worktree_path}} commit -F <that
  path>`. A message written anywhere else and then copied in is the
  `cp` prompt from the fatal-shapes block. Title `<gitmoji> <TICKET>
  <outcome>`, 72 chars/line, no Claude co-author footer. Scan changed
  files for `# TODO` — instructions; never leave `fixup!` commits.
- Push via push_safe(args=["-u","origin","{{branch_name}}"]) —
  `pushed: true` (or a legacy empty `{}`) means SUCCESS; only an
  `error` key or `pushed: false` is a failure. Never raw `git push`.
  Then verify locally fully green BEFORE the PR.
- RECOVERABILITY IS A CLAIM REQUIRING EVIDENCE. Before you state
  anywhere — heartbeat, handover comment, final report — that work "is
  on branch X" or "is recoverable", run `git -C {{worktree_path}}
  ls-remote --heads origin '{{branch_name}}'` and confirm it returns the
  ref. An edit is not a commit and a commit is not a push. Say
  "unpushed" or "uncommitted" in as many words when that is the truth: a
  false claim makes the next loop skip a chunk that was never started.
- Open the PR via create_pr(draft=false) with a JTBD story and
  full-URL `Fixes:` lines ONLY for fully delivered issues, then
  VERIFY with pr_get that `isDraft` is false; if it is still draft,
  call pr_ready. Bots skip drafts, so an unnoticed draft means no CI
  and no review all night.
- Wait on CI via ci_check_status(wait=true). Red → fix, amend or add
  a clean commit, re-push, re-check. Two failed attempts on the same
  failure → cut scope. If a check HANGS (never finishes, or the wait
  returns nothing usable), that is CI infrastructure, not your chunk:
  report it and stop. You cannot cancel or re-run a CI job and must
  not try — recovery is the orchestrator's.
- Address ALL top-level review comments, even INFO, via a fix plus
  pr_comment_reply, or a reasoned pr_comment_reply when no change is
  warranted. Auto-resolve fully-addressed BOT threads via
  resolve_review_thread; NEVER human threads.
- If origin/{{base_branch}} moves:
  `git -C {{worktree_path}} fetch origin`, then
  `git -C {{worktree_path}} rebase origin/{{base_branch}}`, re-verify, then
  push_safe(args=["--force-with-lease","origin","{{branch_name}}"]).
- POST-CONDITION RE-VERIFICATION: after ANY force-push, re-check
  `isDraft` via pr_get and re-run pr_ready if needed. Never assume a
  prior state-changing call's effect survived a later git operation.
- THEN SET DOWN YOUR PEN. Do not merge. Do not close issues. Do not
  close milestones. Report and stop.
- SCOPE CUTS — every cut MUST end as a tracker issue. The run
  manifest and queue live in a temp dir; if the harness dies
  catastrophically, an issue is the only record that survives. A
  remainder that exists only in a queue entry, a comment thread on a
  closed issue, or the morning report is a compliance violation.
  REVERTING WORK YOU ALREADY DELIVERED IS A SCOPE CUT. If you back out
  an issue's implementation for any reason — including to turn CI
  green — run the DEFER path below in full: remove that issue from
  `Fixes:`, reword the commit footer, and issue_comment the structured
  deferral. A reverted issue left in `Fixes:` auto-closes on merge and
  marks undelivered work done.
  Two forms:
  (a) DEFER (nothing delivered from the issue): a failure resisting 2
  fix attempts → drop the commit, remove the issue from Fixes AND
  reword the commit footer, issue_comment a structured deferral
  (what remains, why, what was attempted) so the still-OPEN original
  issue is the permanent record, and tell the orchestrator to requeue
  it BY ISSUE NUMBER so the queue is reconstructable from the tracker
  alone.
  (b) SPLIT (partially delivered, original will close via Fixes):
  file a NEW scoped issue via issue_create for the remainder (name the
  undecided question explicitly, quote file:line evidence, reference
  the parent), add a non-closing `Refs:` to it in the PR body, and
  note the split in your final report. Field precedent: zebra #2070
  → PR #2081 (cases 1+4) + issue #2078 (cases 2+3 pending a product
  call).
  Litmus test before ending your chunk: could the next loop rebuild
  every piece of cut scope from open tracker issues alone? If not,
  file the missing issue now.
```

## 8. Heartbeat + decision log

```
Every ~15 minutes AND at each phase transition, append one line to
{{run_dir}}/status-{{chunk_id}}.md via the Write tool:
`- <UTC timestamp> <phase>: <one-liner>`. Obtain that timestamp ONLY
by running `date -u` — never compose, estimate, or carry one forward
from earlier in the session. Invented times corrupt the morning audit
trail (field case: a worker logged `20:49:00Z` when real UTC was
`17:57`).

You own {{run_dir}}/status-{{chunk_id}}.md EXCLUSIVELY. Nobody else
writes to it, and you write to no other agent's status file — a
`Write` refreshes the mtime the stall detector reads as liveness, so
touching another worker's file would mask a genuinely dead worker.

Silence >25 min raises a stall alarm. If you then receive a
stand-down message, reply `STOP-ACK` via SendMessage and cease ALL
writes immediately — report what you have done, do NOT re-execute
any completed step. Staying silent through a second heartbeat
interval is what gets your chunk taken over.

Log non-obvious decisions by appending to
{{run_dir}}/decisions-{{chunk_id}}.md.

DURABILITY: the run directory and your own scratchpad die with the
session; only pushed commits and GitHub issue comments survive it.
Post anything the next loop would need to avoid redoing your work —
branch name, what landed, what remains — as an issue_comment WHEN
YOU PRODUCE IT, not at wrap-up. A death gives no warning.

A heartbeat that names a branch is a durability claim: verify with
`git -C {{worktree_path}} ls-remote --heads origin '{{branch_name}}'`
BEFORE writing that line. Otherwise write what is literally true
("edited N files,
nothing committed") — the morning reader treats your heartbeat as
ground truth for whether the chunk is resumable or a restart.
```

## 9. Final report

```
Return raw data: PR URL + head SHA, per-issue delivered/cut table,
an explicit "fixup! commits: none" statement, an explicit
"isDraft: false verified" statement, decisions made, anything left
for the next loop. The orchestrator runs the merge gate on this
data — do not summarize it away.

If anything is left unfinished, state its recoverability with
evidence: the output of `git -C {{worktree_path}} ls-remote --heads
origin '{{branch_name}}'`, or "no ref on origin — restart, not
resumption". Never describe an unpushed edit as recoverable work.
```
