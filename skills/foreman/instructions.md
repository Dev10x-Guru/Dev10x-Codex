# Dev10x:foreman — Full Workflow

The cast: **supervisor** (the human, leaving), **watchdog** (the main
session — you), **foreman** (a cheap overseer subagent managing the
crew), **crew** (delivery workers running the Dev10x:work-on bundle
lifecycle). The supervisor reads the shift log in the morning.

**The cast is split by tool surface, not just by job.** Only the
watchdog can call `Skill(...)`; the foreman and crew are
`Agent`-spawned subagents reaching MCP wrappers only after an explicit
`ToolSearch` select-query, and never skills. Delivery therefore stops
at PR-open and the merge gate runs in the watchdog:
[`references/tool-surface.md`](references/tool-surface.md) (GH-922).

**Founding principle — the pre-approval window is a one-time
resource.** Every loop, watcher, and per-domain tool the night will
need must be enumerated and approved in Phase 0, while the supervisor
is still present — a permission prompt at 02:00 freezes a turn until
morning.

## Orchestration

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.**
`TaskCreate(subject="Run foreman night shift", activeForm="Running
night shift")`, marked completed at Phase 3 wrap-up.

## Phase 0 — Intake & Pre-flight (supervisor present; REQUIRED gates)

### 0.1 Build the queue

Resolve the input via `issue_list` / `issue_get`, reading milestone
descriptions for declared dependencies. Chunk the work — one milestone
or coherent bundle per chunk, **sequential by default** (reach for
`Dev10x:fanout` only for provably disjoint file sets). Order by
dependency, pushing risky/decision-hungry chunks to the queue END.
Classify each chunk: `mechanical` / `standard` / `domain-heavy`.

**Convergence files force serialization (GH-1214 finding 5).** Disjoint
*feature* scope is not disjoint *file* scope: settings, url tables, the
DI container and a generated schema are edited by nearly every change,
and four "disjoint" parallel workers sharing them cost one conflict
rebase per merge across the whole tail. Name the repo's convergence
files at Phase 0.4 and record them in the manifest; any two chunks
sharing one go sequential and adjacent, second rebased onto the first.
Chunks sharing none may run in parallel. Evidence and the effect on the
0.2 estimate: [`references/queue-and-model.md`](references/queue-and-model.md).

### 0.2 Queue & model gate (REQUIRED AskUserQuestion)

Present the chunk plan with a per-chunk model recommendation derived
from the classification — the supervisor confirms or overrides:
`domain-heavy` → strongest model; `standard` → strong model;
`mechanical` → mid-tier; foreman overseer → cheap tier (relays,
monitors, spawns — never writes code). Never map the cheapest tier to
delivery work. Also ask which chunks the supervisor wants deferred or
excluded tonight.

### 0.3 Gate policy — adaptive + afk by default (GH-944)

**Default composition: `gate_preset: adaptive` + `gate_overlays:
[afk]`** — auto-advancing walk-away; the supervisor opts *out*, not
in. If the durable policy source already covers this checkout
(`~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml`), honor it verbatim and **skip the
gate**. Otherwise, offer the override once — **REQUIRED: Call
`AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text):

- `adaptive + afk` **(Recommended)** — full walk-away, merges
  included; the default this harness assumes
- `guided + afk` — walk-away pipeline, but merge stays a human action
  (`merge: skip`); pick this on a shared/team repo
- `strict` — every gate fires; only sane if the supervisor is in fact
  staying

**No contrary answer means the default.** Invoke `Skill(Dev10x:afk)`
to compose it. Never offer `bypassPermissions` / auto-mode as an
answer to prompt risk — this harness is never YOLO. Full
durable-policy-check procedure and the GH-978 worktree caveat (a
fresh `isolation="worktree"` checkout can see a phantom merge-gate
`ask`):
[`references/gate-policy-detail.md`](references/gate-policy-detail.md).

### 0.4 Permission pre-flight (the one-time window)

Enumerate and dry-run EVERY command shape the night will use: the
`dev10x foreman probe` CLI shape, one call per MCP wrapper, the
subagent `ToolSearch` bootstrap **plus the CWD mode self-test
(`cd <worktree>` then `pwd`, separate calls) and the git shape that
mode implies — plain `git status --short` in Mode P, `git -C <worktree>
status --short` in Mode C — inside that same probe subagent** (GH-1030
— worker-side git is what actually wedges; GH-1050 — probing the wrong
mode's shape proves nothing, and `git -C` is *denied* as redundant when
CWD already matches), per-domain test
tools, script-deliverable dry-runs (GH-961), and run-directory write
access. Enumerate the **watchdog's own** gate and triage shapes too,
not just the crew's (GH-1058), and dry-run
`resolve_gate(gate="merge", context={})` — a non-`auto-advance` effect
means tonight's first merge request freezes the run, and Phase 0.3 is
the last moment anyone can fix that (GH-1051).
Any prompt fired during pre-flight = fix it NOW, or that shape is
BANNED for the night. Full checklist:
[`references/preflight-checklist.md`](references/preflight-checklist.md).

**Probe at crew depth, not watchdog depth (GH-1214 finding 2).** The
probe subagent is spawned by the top-level session (depth 1); a crew
worker is spawned by the foreman subagent (depth 2). A run where
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__*` was absent for the foreman AND every worker
for 27 hours passed this pre-flight 12 of 12 — the probe measured the
watchdog's surface. So spawn the overseer FIRST and have *it* spawn the
probe. An empty result at either depth selects the **narrow contract**
(workers commit/push and write a PR-body file; the watchdog opens the
PR and owns CI and merge), declared in the manifest before dispatch:
[`references/mcp-connectivity.md`](references/mcp-connectivity.md)
§ Absent from spawn.

### 0.5 Write the run manifest

Create the run directory (`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp`, namespace
`foreman`) and write `manifest.md` (queue order, per-chunk model +
scope, friction level, base branch, verified command shapes, deferred
chunks). Workers and the foreman heartbeat one `status-<chunk>.md`
each into this directory.

## Phase 1 — Arm the harness

1. Start the single watcher (one Monitor call, script-only — NEVER an
   inline loop/pipeline): `dev10x foreman watch --scratchpad <run-dir>
   --base-branch <base>`, using the CLI shape Phase 0.4 recorded. It
   emits `STALL <file>:` (one line per silent heartbeat file, already
   naming the chunk — GH-1064), `MERGE REQUEST` / `ESCALATION` (tailed
   off `escalations-*.md`, so a request reaches you within a poll
   interval instead of whenever its message lands — GH-1060),
   `BASE MOVED:`, `QUOTA MILESTONE:`, `QUOTA RESET:`,
   and the forward-looking `QUOTA LOW:` (GH-979). Three watchdog-owned
   run-directory files keep that feed decision-only (GH-946):
   `merged-shas`, `parked`, `current-generation`. Full event semantics
   and the file table:
   [`references/architecture.md`](references/architecture.md).
2. **Arm the external wake timer (GH-1109).** The watcher above runs
   inside this session, so a platform quota pause takes it down with
   everything else — `QUOTA RESET` then fires into a queue nobody is
   reading. Install a cron/systemd timer calling
   `dev10x watchdog wake --run-root <runs-parent> --wake-command
   '<resume-command>'` every few minutes; it is idempotent per block
   boundary, so a live session ignores it. Verify with
   `dev10x watchdog probe` and a `--dry-run` wake, per Phase 0.4.
   Without this the run cannot resume itself: the 2026-08-31 run lost
   five hours of available capacity between a 01:00Z reset and a 06:28Z
   human nudge.
3. Spawn the **foreman** overseer (cheap model, named agent), and
   write `current-generation` naming it before the spawn returns. It
   manages the queue per the manifest — one crew worker per chunk,
   relays `BASE MOVED` and merge requests, verifies per-chunk closure
   itself (GH-922), and keeps `roster.md` current (GH-976) —
   `manifest.md` stays authoritative. It can never call
   `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-merge)`. Full brief:
   [`references/overseer-discipline.md`](references/overseer-discipline.md)
   and
   [`references/architecture.md`](references/architecture.md).

## Phase 2 — The night loop (watchdog discipline)

The watchdog (main session) does the MINIMUM — its context and its
turn are the most precious resources on site:

- React ONLY to watcher events and foreman messages. No
  implementation work, no exploratory reads, no polling loops.
- `STALL` → run the **stand-down handshake** BEFORE any takeover,
  respawn, or `TaskStop`. Heartbeat silence proves not-progressing,
  never gone — a revived worker is a live conflict risk a dead one is
  not. In order:
  1. Send the stalled agent a direct message naming every action
     already completed on its chunk (branch, commits, PR, merges,
     comments posted) and instructing it to **reply `STOP-ACK` and
     cease all writes** — report state, do not re-execute anything.
  2. Wait one more heartbeat interval (~15 min / the next watcher
     tick). Any reply is strong evidence of liveness: resume it with a
     corrective brief instead of replacing it.
  3. Only if it stays silent through that SECOND window does takeover
     proceed — the foreman handles a crew worker, the watchdog a
     silent foreman. `TaskStop`, then pick the path by what the corpse
     left behind: nothing committed → respawn from `manifest.md` and
     the newest heartbeats; **complete but UNCOMMITTED work →
     watchdog-driven lifecycle completion in the ORIGINAL worktree,
     never a respawn**, because a fresh `Agent(isolation="worktree")`
     gets a new worktree and reports success on a tree it cannot see.

  Never skip step 1 because spend went flat, and disambiguate the
  signal first (GH-972 F1/F3, GH-971 F3) — the watcher's mtime also
  ages on a crew composition change or under spawn-by-request, and a
  replaced foreman is not necessarily gone. Full evidence, the
  idle-notification asymmetry, disambiguation tables, and the
  authority-token wording every foreman prompt must include:
  `references/stall-protocol.md` and
  [`references/generation-authority.md`](references/generation-authority.md).
  Who may enter a dead worker's tree, and the two sanctioned recovery
  paths when it holds uncommitted work:
  [`references/worktree-recovery.md`](references/worktree-recovery.md).
- `BASE MOVED` → relay to the foreman (it instructs the active worker
  to rebase, re-verify, and never merge on stale ancestry).
- **`MERGE REQUEST <chunk>` from the foreman → run the merge gate.**
  The one piece of real work the watchdog owns — `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-merge)`
  is unreachable from a subagent. Re-read live state first (CI
  verdict, `isDraft`, mergeability, ancestry) — a worker's report is a
  memory, not a fact — then merge, close the chunk's issues, and
  **append the new base-branch tip SHA to `merged-shas`** so the
  watcher mutes the echo. Refuse the request if anything is pending,
  draft, conflicting, or carries `fixup!` commits, and send it back to
  the foreman with the failing check named.
  **If the watchdog's OWN MCP surface has died, it cannot recover it —
  `ToolSearch` does not re-resolve never-deferred top-level tools
  (GH-1099).** Fall back to sanctioned `gh api` for the gate READS,
  queue the merges rather than hand-rolling `gh pr merge`, and ask the
  supervisor to run `/mcp`:
  [`references/mcp-connectivity.md`](references/mcp-connectivity.md).
- **`QUOTA LOW` → decide within the turn: finish or checkpoint, then
  park.** Within merge distance (PR open, CI green, no unresolved
  threads) → let it land, then park. Otherwise → relay a WIP
  checkpoint + status comment, then touch `parked` and hold until
  `QUOTA RESET`. Log the decision in `DECISIONS.md`; resume from the
  checkpoint rather than respawning cold.
- **Holding the queue** for any reason → touch `parked` before going
  idle, remove it on release (mutes stall/quota noise, GH-946).
- `QUOTA RESET` → tell the foreman to resume or respawn interrupted
  crew. A pause is not a death — but a fresh **session** cannot reach
  prior crew at all; re-derive every inherited claim from origin
  (`references/durability-envelope.md`, GH-965).
  **You will only see this event if the session is awake to receive it
  (GH-1109).** A platform pause silences the session's own event queue,
  so a reset that lands while paused arrives nowhere. The external
  `dev10x watchdog` timer armed in Phase 1 is what re-enters the
  session; without it the run sleeps until a human nudges it.
- Never write into a crew worker's `status-<chunk>.md` — it refreshes
  the mtime the stall detector reads as liveness.
- A decision only the supervisor can make → cut the scope per the crew
  contract (always leaves a tracker issue), move the chunk to the
  queue end, and log it as a numbered `DECISIONS.md` entry.
- **Escalations go to disk FIRST, then to a message** (GH-962 F2) —
  and the disk write includes a `MERGE REQUEST` / `ESCALATION` line in
  `escalations-<role>.md`, which is the line the watcher turns into an
  event and therefore the one that actually wakes you (GH-1060) — and
  the overseer's own wait discipline (heartbeat → ONE bounded blocking
  wait → heartbeat → act, never ending a turn mid-chunk) is a
  documented contract, not a matter of style. Full cycle:
  [`references/overseer-discipline.md`](references/overseer-discipline.md).

## Phase 3 — Morning wrap-up (REQUIRED, in order)

1. Verify: every queued chunk's issues closed or carrying a
   cut-rationale comment; milestones closed; no orphaned open PRs;
   stop the watcher and retire the foreman. **Remove the Phase 1 wake
   timer** — it outlives the session that armed it, so a timer left
   installed keeps nudging runs that no longer exist.
2. Consolidate `DECISIONS.md` + per-chunk decision files into the
   morning report — confirm every `roster.md` row against the tracker
   first, since a rendering is not evidence. Optional HTML artifact
   alongside the markdown, never a gate:
   [`../../references/html-artifact-reporting.md`](../../references/html-artifact-reporting.md).
3. **Self-audit:** collect every prompted, denied, or hook-blocked
   command from the night; run `Skill(Dev10x:diag-friction)` on each;
   file upstream issues for the structural ones. Queue
   `Skill(Dev10x:skill-audit-queue)` for the session.
4. `Skill(Dev10x:session-wrap-up)` to route anything unfinished.

## Crew contract (what every worker prompt must contain)

Build each worker prompt from `references/crew-prompt-template.md`.
The twelve non-negotiable elements and the field failure behind each
one live in
[`references/crew-contract.md`](references/crew-contract.md) — read
it before writing any worker prompt. A prompt missing ANY of them is
not shippable; in headline form: `background_preamble` verbatim,
`ToolSearch` bootstrap with zero `Skill(...)` calls, lifecycle stops
at PR-open, `isDraft` re-verification after every push, anti-stall
single-shot `ci_check_status`, named per-domain test tools (Phase
0.4), heartbeat into `status-<chunk>.md`, scope-cut protocol, review
discipline (zero `fixup!` left), a per-chunk decision log,
`git ls-remote`-backed recoverability claims, and the durability
envelope stated explicitly.

## Collapsed mode & merge guidance when no watcher is armed

Collapsed mode drops the overseer tier — the watchdog dispatches,
observes and gates the crew itself. It is rung 3 of the overseer
fallback ladder in `references/overseer-discipline.md`, not a first
response. When to choose it, what it costs, and the merge rules that
apply with no `dev10x foreman watch` armed (never a crew worker):
[`references/collapsed-merge-guidance.md`](references/collapsed-merge-guidance.md).

## Red flags — STOP, you are about to lose the night

- An inline `while`/`sleep`/pipeline in a Monitor or Bash call —
  "it passed before" is meaningless; shapes re-match per call. Use
  `dev10x foreman watch` (or `uv run dev10x foreman watch` when the
  bare entry point is not installed — GH-947).
- A worker prompt without the background preamble or named test tools.
- A worker prompt containing a `Skill(...)` call, or reaching for an
  MCP wrapper without the `ToolSearch` bootstrap first.
- A crew worker merging a PR or closing an issue — that is the
  watchdog's gate, and a worker doing it ran no checks at all. Nothing
  stops it in code: `merge_pr` is loadable by any subagent (GH-1061).
- An OVERSEER merging, closing an issue/milestone, `TaskStop`-ing
  before the second stand-down window, or skipping a queue chunk with
  no `DECISIONS.md` entry.
- A MERGE REQUEST whose decision log carries no `ci_check_status`
  output the sender ran itself.
- A worker reverting delivered work while that issue stays in
  `Fixes:` — a revert is a scope cut, and the merge auto-closes it.
- Trusting `isDraft`, CI verdict, or mergeability read before the
  last force-push. Re-read, then decide.
- "We'll add the allow rule when it prompts" — the supervisor is
  asleep; there is no *when*.
- A watchdog gate or stall-triage command whose shape was never
  pre-flighted — the crew's probe proves nothing about yours.
- Arming the night without a dry-run `resolve_gate(gate="merge")`
  showing `auto-advance`.
- Handing a worker a way to see a check went red without a proven
  shape for reading *why*.
- Offering auto-mode / bypassPermissions to silence prompt risk.
- Merging on pending CI, stale ancestry, or with `fixup!` commits.
- The watchdog "quickly" doing implementation work in the main session.
- Two open PRs from overlapping file areas.
- Taking over a stalled chunk without the stand-down handshake, or
  citing flat spend as corroborating evidence that a worker is dead.
- `TaskStop`-ing a foreman whose heartbeat is stale because it is
  waiting on a relay you sent it — or because spawn-by-request left
  it with no event source at all.
- Executing a relayed worker spec without checking that the file
  paths it cites actually exist.
- Reading a `STALL <file>` as a verdict instead of a prompt to check
  that chunk's branch tip and PR state.
- Two files stalling at the same command shape read as two dead
  workers rather than as one unmatched shape wedging both.
- Sending a MERGE REQUEST without appending it to
  `escalations-<role>.md` — the message may batch for hours; the file
  is what the watcher turns into an event.
- Any record — heartbeat, handover, resumption note, morning report —
  calling work "recoverable on branch X" without a `git ls-remote`
  that shows the ref on origin.
- Relaying orders as a foreman without re-reading `current-generation`
  first.
- An overseer announcing it will "go passive and heartbeat every N
  minutes" — it cannot; that is a false STALL per window.
- Sending a time-critical escalation by message without writing it to
  `DECISIONS.md` first.
- Answering a worker's phantom merge-gate `ask` one relay at a time
  instead of authorizing every worker at spawn.
- Anyone but the owning worker writing to `status-<chunk>.md`, or
  anyone but the foreman writing to `roster.md`.
- A chunk state recorded ONLY in `roster.md` — it is a derived view,
  so anything not also in `manifest.md` or a decision log is lost the
  moment a fresh foreman rebuilds it.
- Firing an `AskUserQuestion` the handoff already answered. Under afk
  this freezes the run until the supervisor returns. A mid-run
  clarifying question is NOT authorization to open a gate — answer
  inline and continue.

## Rationalization table

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This Monitor one-liner is simple, no script needed" | The 7-hour overnight freeze was exactly such a one-liner. Script or nothing. |
| "The worker knows the repo conventions" | It has a fresh system prompt. It knows nothing you didn't put in it. |
| "The prompt says `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-merge)`, so the 9 checks run" | The worker cannot call it. Naming a skill a subagent cannot reach buys the appearance of a gate and none of the gate. |
| "The worker reported the PR is ready and green — merge it" | That is a memory of a past state. Force-pushes re-draft PRs and bases move. Re-read `isDraft`, CI, and ancestry at the gate. |
| "A worker can't merge — it has no `gh-pr-merge` skill" | The skill, no; `merge_pr` yes — it is a deferred MCP tool any subagent can `ToolSearch` for, and one did exactly that and merged. The stop is prompt-deep only (GH-1061). |
| "The third overseer just died too — spawn a fourth" | Three identical failures is evidence about the tier, not the agent. Raise the model tier or collapse to watchdog-direct (`references/overseer-discipline.md`). |
| "The foreman relayed that the issues are closed" | Only if the foreman actually called `issue_get`. Without its ToolSearch bootstrap it is repeating the worker's claim, and verification has degraded into transcription. |
| "Pending CI, but everything else is green — merge" | Pending is not green. The field case: a check stuck `in_progress` with `conclusion=success` needed a job re-run, not a merge. |
| "The idle notification means the worker is stuck" | Idle pings fire between turns and arrive late/out of order — they prove neither liveness nor death. Heartbeat mtime, live PR/CI state, and a REPLY to a direct message are the evidence. |
| "Heartbeat is 28 min stale — it's dead, take the chunk over" | Silence means *not progressing*, not *dead*. Field case: a worker declared dead woke 22 min later, re-ran its whole mission, and posted duplicate rationale comments on the PR the takeover had already finished. Handshake first. |
| "Spend has been flat for 30 min, that corroborates it's dead" | A cheap idle agent and a dead agent are indistinguishable on a spend graph. Flat cost is not evidence of death — it is not evidence of anything. |
| "The foreman hasn't heartbeat since I sent the relay — respawn it" | It is idle by instruction, waiting on you. Killing it destroys a healthy overseer and resets the queue. Ask it to report first. |
| "I replaced the foreman, so the old one is gone" | A session-limit death PAUSES a top-level session and KILLS only its subagents. The predecessor can revive and issue orders to a crew that no longer exists. `current-generation` is what makes it stand down. |
| "Spawn-by-request says run the spec verbatim, so I don't read it" | Verbatim governs *authorship*, not review. Under that fallback a cheap-tier agent writes the prompts, and a hallucinated file path becomes a top-tier worker's whole mission. Check the cited paths resolve; it costs seconds. |
| "The foreman's heartbeat is stale again — it must be wedged this time" | Under spawn-by-request it has no event source, so a stale foreman heartbeat is the *normal* state. Check the crew's per-file mtimes and branch tips before touching the overseer. |
| "The watcher fired `STALL`, so something is stalled" | It reports one named file that stopped changing — which also happens on a crew handoff and on an idle-by-design overseer. The event attributes the silence; only the chunk's git/PR state classifies it. |
| "Skip the pre-flight, the allowlist looked fine last week" | Allow rules are shape-sensitive and repos drift. Pre-flight is minutes; a missed shape is the night. |
| "The worker said it committed the migration on branch X — resume from there" | An edit is not a commit and a commit is not a push. Field case: the branch never existed on origin and the worktree died with four uncommitted files; the chunk was a restart. `git ls-remote --heads origin '<glob>'` before you believe it. |
| "I'll wait passively and heartbeat every 10 minutes" | An idle agent runs no code. There is no timer and nothing wakes it. Heartbeat, make ONE bounded blocking wait, heartbeat again — or accept a false STALL every window. |
| "I messaged the watchdog about it, so it's escalated" | Messages are best-effort and have arrived hours late, batched behind unrelated pings. `DECISIONS.md` is the authoritative record and the `escalations-<role>.md` line is what the watcher turns into an event; the message is only a nudge that both exist. |
| "The merge gate returned `ask`, so the supervisor wants to decide" | In a fresh isolation worktree that `ask` is a resolver fallback — no session policy, no matching config glob — not a supervisor decision (GH-978, fix landed on `janusz/GH-978/worktree-gate-policy`, pending merge). Workers stop at PR-open regardless. |
| "Cheaper models everywhere will stretch the quota" | A failed chunk costs more than the model discount saves. Downgrade the overseer, never the crew. |
