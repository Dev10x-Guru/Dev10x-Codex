# Audit Report — File Findings Upstream

Generate a structured GitHub issue from skill-audit findings
and file it at the plugin repo that owns the offending skill.

## When to Use

- Delegated by `Dev10x:skill-audit` Phase 7 after the user
  approves upstream reporting **and** confirms the destination
  tracker at the Phase 7 sub-step B2 gate
- Can also be invoked standalone with a findings file

## Arguments

Two arguments:

1. `--repo <owner>/<repo>` — the target issue tracker (GH-816).
   Required when the caller resolved a destination. Skills from
   every installed plugin live under `~/.claude/plugins/`, so the
   owner cannot be inferred here — the caller resolves it via
   `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_plugin_origin` and confirms it
   with the user.
2. Path to a findings markdown file produced by
   `Dev10x:skill-audit`.

**Target repo resolution:**

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `--repo` passed | File there. Never override it. |
| No `--repo`, findings file has a `**Target repo**:` line | Use that value. |
| Neither present | **REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** asking which repo receives the issue (do NOT use plain text, do NOT silently default to `Dev10x-Guru/dev10x-claude`). Offer the detected plugin repos when the findings name one, plus a free-text override. |

Store the resolved value as `$TARGET_REPO` — every later step
(version detection, label sync, filing) uses it.

The findings file contains:

```markdown
## Session Context

- **Repo**: {repo-name}
- **Branch**: {branch-name}
- **Date**: {audit-date}
- **Target repo**: {owner}/{repo}

## Upstream Findings

| # | Phase | Classification | Skill | Description |
|---|-------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Proposed Fixes

{Grouped by skill}
```

If no argument is provided, check for the most recent file in
`/tmp/Dev10x/skill-audit/` matching `findings*.md`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read findings

Read the findings file passed as argument. Validate it contains
at least one finding row in the table.

If empty or missing, inform the user and exit.

### Step 2: Determine plugin version

Report the version of the plugin the findings are **about**, not
the Dev10x version. The caller's origin resolution supplies the
marketplace, plugin, and version; when the findings file carries a
`**Plugin**: {marketplace}/{plugin} {version}` line, use it
directly.

Otherwise list the owning plugin's cache directory:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/{marketplace}/{plugin}/
```

Use the version directory name (e.g., `0.19.0.dev0`). If the
cache directory is not found, use `unknown`.

### Step 3: Fictionalize proprietary information (REQUIRED)

**Treat the source session as private by default.** The upstream
issue is a public artifact at `$TARGET_REPO` and MUST
NOT disclose any identifier from a non-public repository, project,
branch, ticket tracker, file path, person, or service that is not
part of the public Dev10x plugin.

Instead of redacting private identifiers with bracketed
placeholders (`<private-repo>`, `TICKET-NN`), **replace them with
similar-sounding fictional counterparts drawn from pop culture** —
movies, books, TV, cartoons, video games. The resulting issue
reads as a coherent story while leaking nothing. Real precedents:
issue #68 used `initech/initech-pos` + reviewer `skywalker`;
issue #98 used Tyrell Corp + Aperture Labs.

Apply the vibe-matching guide, consistency rule, and 6-step
algorithm in
[`references/privacy-scrub.md`](references/privacy-scrub.md) to
the verbatim findings text **before** assembling the issue body.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** when a finding is
fundamentally about a private codebase pattern that cannot be
retold through fictional stand-ins without losing the technical
point (do NOT use plain text). Options:

- Fictionalize aggressively and file (Recommended) — pick the
  closest pop-culture stand-in even at the cost of some
  specificity
- Skip this finding — exclude from upstream, keep in local notes

Never auto-include unfictionalized text. Re-read the assembled
body and verify every named entity is fictional (pop-culture
sourced, not a real company / person / product) before
continuing to Step 4.

### Step 4: Generate issue body

Build the issue body from the **fictionalized** findings:

```markdown
## Audit Findings

**Plugin**: {plugin} {version} (marketplace: {marketplace})
**Session context**: {fictional-org}/{fictional-repo} / {fictional-branch}
**Audit date**: {date}

### Findings

| # | Phase | Classification | Skill | Description |
|---|-------|---------------|-------|-------------|
{fictionalized rows}

### Proposed Fixes

{fictionalized fixes, grouped by skill}

### Evidence

{fictionalized transcript excerpts — 2-3 lines per finding, no
real file paths, real handles, or real product names}
```

The "Session context" line uses fictional stand-ins (e.g.,
`initech/initech-pos / skywalker/CORE-401/death-star-3/...`) so
the report reads as a coherent narrative — the upstream
maintainer does not need the real repo or branch to act on a
Dev10x plugin finding.

### Step 5: Derive issue title

Use the primary skill name (most findings) as the title anchor:

- Single skill: `skill-audit findings: Dev10x:{skill}`
- Multiple skills: `skill-audit findings: Dev10x:{skill} (+N)`

### Step 6: Write body to temp file

```bash
/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh skill-audit upstream-issue .md
```

Write the assembled body to that file using the Write tool.

### Step 7: Derive bundling labels (REQUIRED)

Audit issues are batched by an automated session, so similar
findings should cluster under a shared label and be discoverable
as a bundle during implementation. Derive the label set from the
fictionalized findings BEFORE filing — never hardcode a single
`enhancement` label.

Apply the resolution algorithm in
[`references/labels.md`](references/labels.md):

1. Start with `enhancement`
2. Add one `skill:<name>` per unique skill referenced in the
   findings table (strip the `Dev10x:` prefix; fictionalized names
   only — see Step 3)
3. Scan finding descriptions + proposed fixes against the topical
   heuristic table in `references/labels.md` § 3; add each matching
   topical label once
4. De-duplicate and cap at 8 labels per issue

Do NOT mint a per-session `audit-YYYY-MM-DD` label — the session
date already lives in the issue body's `## Session Context`
section, and dated labels accumulate without bundling value.

Collect the result as a comma-separated string (e.g.,
`enhancement,skill:work-on,routing-bypass`).
Store it as `$LABELS` for Step 8.

### Step 8: Ensure labels exist on the repo (best-effort)

GitHub fails issue creation if any label is missing, so try to
reconcile the set first. Fetch the current labels once and create
only the missing ones:

```bash
gh label list --repo "$TARGET_REPO" --limit 200 \
    --json name -q '.[].name' > /tmp/Dev10x/skill-audit/existing-labels.txt

for label in $(echo "$LABELS" | tr ',' ' '); do
    grep -qxF "$label" /tmp/Dev10x/skill-audit/existing-labels.txt || \
        gh label create "$label" --repo "$TARGET_REPO" \
            --color "$COLOR_FOR_CATEGORY" \
            --description "$DESC_FOR_CATEGORY"
done
```

Colors and descriptions per category live in
`references/labels.md`. `gh label create` is idempotent here
because the loop only runs for missing labels.

**Labels are best-effort — never a filing precondition (GH-931
finding 6).** Every step above can fail for a reporter who is not
a maintainer of `$TARGET_REPO`, and filing the findings matters
more than bundling them:

| Failure | Cause | Response |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `unknown command "label" for "gh"` | `gh` build without the subcommand | Skip reconciliation entirely; go to the no-label fallback |
| `403` / `404` on `label create` | Label creation needs push access | Drop the labels that could not be created |
| `403` / `404` applying labels at filing | Applying labels needs push (triage) access | Re-file with **no** `--label` flag |

**No-label fallback:** when the label set cannot be reconciled or
applied, file with no labels and record the intended set in the
issue body instead, so a maintainer can apply them afterwards:

```markdown
**Suggested labels** (filed without them — no push access):
`enhancement`, `skill:git`, `routing-bypass`
```

Never abort the filing because labels are unavailable. An audit
finding that never reaches the tracker is a total loss; an
unlabelled one is merely harder to bundle.

### Step 9: File the issue

Delegate to `Dev10x:ticket-create` — never use raw `gh issue create`.
Write the title as the first line of the temp file (followed by a
blank line and the body) to avoid permission friction from special
characters in the args string. Pass the comma-separated label set
derived in Step 7 **only when Step 8 confirmed every label exists
and is applicable**:

```
Skill(skill="Dev10x:ticket-create",
  args="--repo {TARGET_REPO} --body-file {temp-file-path} --label {LABELS}")
```

When Step 8 hit any failure above, omit the `--label` flag and
rely on the in-body "Suggested labels" line instead:

```
Skill(skill="Dev10x:ticket-create",
  args="--repo {TARGET_REPO} --body-file {temp-file-path}")
```

If a filing attempt *with* labels is rejected for permissions,
retry once without the flag rather than reporting failure.

The ticket-create skill reads the first line as the title when
no `--title` flag is provided.

### Step 10: Report result

Display the created issue URL. If filing fails, show the error
and the temp file path so the user can file manually.

## Important Rules

- **Always use `--body-file`**: Never pass the body inline via
  `--body` — markdown tables break shell quoting.
- **Plugin skills only**: This skill files issues about skills
  shipped by an installed plugin. User-local findings should never
  appear in the issue body.
- **Destination is supplied, never assumed (GH-816)**: file at
  `$TARGET_REPO`. A finding about a non-Dev10x plugin's skill
  belongs at that plugin's tracker. Do NOT fall back to
  `Dev10x-Guru/dev10x-claude` when `--repo` is absent — raise the
  `AskUserQuestion` gate documented under Arguments instead.
- **No transcript dumps**: Evidence sections include 2-3 lines
  of context per finding, not raw transcript blocks.
- **One issue per audit**: Batch all findings into a single
  issue per audit session to avoid issue spam.
- **Check the tracker before filing (GH-1244)**: The rule above
  guards against *volume*, not against *re-filing* — and a
  duplicate buried inside a batched issue is harder to triage
  than a standalone one, because a maintainer must read every
  finding to discover which are already tracked. Before
  assembling the body, search `$TARGET_REPO` for each finding —
  open **and** closed. Drop the ones already tracked and list
  them in the issue as "already tracked: #N" instead. File only
  what is new. A finding already closed is re-filed only when
  this session shows the behaviour recurring after the close,
  and the body must say so.
- **Quote the shipped file, never recall it (GH-1244)**: A
  finding asserting what a skill documents must carry a quote
  read from the shipped file at filing time. A claim sourced
  from the reporting agent's own invention sends a maintainer
  hunting a defect that does not exist — worse than a duplicate,
  which merely wastes triage. Withdraw any finding the file
  contradicts.
- **Bundle via labels, not separate issues**: Apply the label
  taxonomy in `references/labels.md` so similar issues can be
  filtered and worked together during implementation. Never
  file with only the default `enhancement` label.
- **Privacy by default (Step 3)**: The source session may belong
  to a private codebase. Fictionalize repo names, owners,
  branches, tracker IDs, file paths, hostnames, and personal
  identifiers using pop-culture stand-ins (movies, books,
  cartoons, games) before assembling the issue body. Never use
  real company, product, or person names — even ones that *sound*
  fictional. Only the public Dev10x plugin context — skill names,
  plugin file paths, and `Dev10x-Guru/Dev10x-Claude` issue/PR
  numbers — is allowed verbatim. Re-verify every named entity is
  fictional before filing.
