# Merge PR (Instructions)

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.
Create a task at invocation, mark completed when done:

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Merge PR", activeForm="Merging PR")`

Mark completed when done: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`

## Overview

Pre-merge validation gate that checks 9 conditions before
executing `gh pr merge`. Prevents premature merges like PR #633
(merged with 7 unaddressed review comments) and PRs #690-692
(merged with unaddressed top-level automated review comments).

## Merge Strategy Resolution

The merge strategy is resolved using the config resolution order
(see `references/config-resolution.md`):

1. **Global with repo matching** — read
   `<Dev10x config>/settings-pr-merge.yaml`, match the current repo's
   `org/repo` against `projects[].match_repo` globs (`match:` is a
   deprecated alias for one release, ADR-0026). With no `origin`
   remote there is no `org/repo` to match, so the list is not
   evaluated at all and the default applies.
2. **Default** — `rebase`

Rationale for the `rebase` default: commits authored through this
plugin already follow gitmoji + ticket + JTBD conventions enforced
by `Dev10x:git-commit`, and `Dev10x:git-groom` produces a curated
linear history before merge. Squashing erases that structure and
breaks per-commit references in PR review threads. Rebase preserves
the curated commits as-is.

**Migration note for existing users:** If a project previously relied
on the implicit `squash` default, set `strategy: squash` explicitly
in `<Dev10x config>/settings-pr-merge.yaml` for that repo's
`projects[].match_repo` entry. No behavior change for projects that
already declared `strategy:` explicitly.

### Config file format

**Global format** (preferred — one file for all repos):
```yaml
# <Dev10x config>/settings-pr-merge.yaml
projects:
  - match_repo: "Dev10x-Guru/*"
    strategy: rebase
    delete_branch: true
    solo_maintainer: true
  - match_repo: "example-org/*"
    strategy: rebase
    delete_branch: true
    solo_maintainer: true
  - match_repo: "legacy-org/*"
    strategy: squash   # explicit opt-in to historical default
    delete_branch: true
```

All fields are optional. Defaults:
- `strategy`: `rebase`
- `delete_branch`: `true`
- `solo_maintainer`: `false`

## Self-Check Before Pre-Merge Validation

**REQUIRED — call `TaskList` now.** Do NOT shortcut to `gh pr merge`
based on a single `gh pr view` JSON read — that is the regression this
check exists to catch (GH-112).

**The nine subtask RECORDS are not load-bearing; running and
reporting the nine checks is** (GH-971 F2). What the gate is
defending is that each check was actually *performed against live
state* before the merge — nine `TaskCreate` round-trips are ceremony
that costs a call each and proves nothing the report does not. So
this step is satisfied by BOTH of:

1. The `TaskList` call above, made in THIS invocation.
2. A reported nine-item checklist in which every check names the
   **observed value** it was decided on — `isDraft: false`,
   `mergeable: MERGEABLE`, `verdict: green`, `unresolved threads: 0`,
   and so on. A bare "✓ passed" per line does not satisfy it: an
   unverifiable tick is exactly the shortcut GH-112 caught.

Creating the subtasks is still fine — preferred when the merge is one
step of a longer plan the supervisor is watching — but their absence
is not a violation, and you must never skip a *check* because its
task record does not exist. If a check cannot be run, HALT and report
which one and why; do not merge.

**Unskippable on every invocation (GH-253):** The `TaskList` call
above runs ONCE per skill invocation, at Step 1, before any check
or `gh pr merge` execution. It is not optional and it is not
satisfied by a prior invocation's call. If you proceed past Step 1
without calling `TaskList` in this invocation, HALT with the
message: "gh-pr-merge Step 1 self-check skipped — restart from
Step 1." Do not jump to Step 5 (`gh pr merge` / `merge_pr`) based
on the agent's recollection that "the checks just passed" — those
checks belong to a sibling skill's context, not this one.

**Re-invocation contract:** Every invocation of `Dev10x:gh-pr-merge`
re-runs the full skill body from Step 1, including all 9 pre-merge
checks. Check results from a prior `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` phase,
prior `Dev10x:verify-acc-dod` run, or earlier invocation of this
same skill are NOT reusable. CI state, review comments, draft
toggles, and force-push state can drift between invocations — the
9 checks exist precisely to detect that drift.

### Subagent handoff exception (GH-1093)

The re-invocation contract has ONE bounded exception. A worker
subagent that ran the 9 checks and could not fire an `ALWAYS_ASK`
gate — `AskUserQuestion` is not exposed to background subagents —
hands its report to the orchestrator holding the standing
authorization. Re-running all 9 there validated every merge twice
for ~3–4× duplicated tool traffic per PR.

The exception applies ONLY when ALL of these hold:

1. The report carries `head_sha`, `measured_at`, the
   `blocked_gate` and its evidence, and an **observed value** per
   check (a bare "✓ passed" does not count).
2. A fresh `pr_get` shows the PR still open with a head SHA
   identical to the reported one.
3. The orchestrator re-runs the time-sensitive checks itself:
   Check 2 (CI) and Checks 1 / 1b / 1c (comments — the GH-462 F3
   late-comment race). Checks 2b / 3 / 4 / 7 ride along on the
   same fresh `pr_get` from step 2, so they are never inherited.

Only Checks 1d, 5 and 6 may then be accepted from the report:
each is a function of the commit graph or of worker-local state
the orchestrator cannot observe, and the unchanged head SHA pins
all three.

**Any HEAD mismatch, any missing field, or a report older than 30
minutes → full re-run, as today.** When in doubt, re-run. The
exception removes duplicated traffic; it never licenses a merge
on a stale reading. Report schema, per-check reasoning, and the
bl-zebra evidence:
[`references/subagent-handoff.md`](references/subagent-handoff.md).

**Audit the report before inheriting anything (GH-1380).** The
three conditions above were prose the orchestrator applied by eye,
and a report that narrates the pipeline reads exactly like one that
reports it. Write the report and the fresh `pr_get` response to
files (`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp`) and run:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gh-pr-merge/scripts/audit-handoff-report.py \
  --report-file <report.json> --pr-state-file <pr-get.json>
```

It prints a JSON verdict on stdout and exits non-zero unless the
verdict is `accept`. **Exit non-zero forbids the exception** — run
all 9 checks yourself. The `already_merged` verdict is the GH-1380
case: the PR merged before the report could gate it, so the report
describes someone else's work. Attribute the merge per Check 2b
rather than asking the worker for a better report; there is no
report that can authorize a merge that already happened.

**"Re-run the skill" expansion:** When the supervisor says
"execute the whole skill again", "re-run the skill", "run it once
more", or any equivalent phrasing, treat that as a fresh invocation
starting from Step 1 of this body — NOT as "resume from the last
unfinished step" or "skip to the merge command". The full skill
body, including all 9 checks, runs every time.

Session policy does NOT waive this skill body. Whatever
`resolve_gate(gate="merge")` returns at Step 5 governs only the
final ask/auto-advance/skip decision immediately before
executing the merge; the 9 checks below still run
unconditionally on every invocation. See
`references/friction-levels.md` § "The baseline does not waive
skill bodies".

## Pre-Merge Validation Checks

Run ALL 9 checks before merging. Report results as a checklist.
If ANY check fails, refuse to merge and report which failed.

### Check 1: No unresolved review threads

Query unresolved review threads via the MCP wrapper — never raw
`gh api graphql` (GH-598). The wrapper runs the `reviewThreads`
GraphQL query and returns only the unresolved threads:

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__unresolved_threads(repo="OWNER/REPO", pr_number=NUMBER)
```

`unresolved_threads` requires an explicit `repo` (no CWD default);
pass `pr_number` so it runs the fast single-PR GraphQL query rather
than a repo-wide merged-PR sweep. Each returned thread is
unresolved; report the count and first comment of each.

**AFK bot-authored auto-remediation (GH-858 F1).** Each returned
thread carries `author_type` (`"bot"` / `"human"`). A bot-to-bot
review cycle that has already been addressed must not block a
walk-away merge on a supervisor prompt. So before treating an
unresolved-thread count as a hard failure, resolve
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="thread_resolution",
context={"author_type": "bot"})`:

- When its `effect == "auto-advance"` (AFK) **and every** unresolved
  thread has `author_type == "bot"`, do NOT stop here. Auto-delegate
  to `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-respond)` — the same auto-remediation shape
  Check 2 uses for CI failures — to address/auto-resolve the bot
  threads, then re-run Check 1.
- Fall through to the hard stop only when **any** thread has
  `author_type == "human"`, or when `gh-pr-respond` itself surfaces
  an `AskUserQuestion` (its own gate result is authoritative). A
  single human-authored unresolved thread keeps the whole check
  blocking — the all-bot condition must be strict.

### Check 1b: No unaddressed top-level PR comments (GH-698)

**REQUIRED:** This check MUST run after Check 1. Top-level PR
comments are invisible to the `reviewThreads` GraphQL query —
skipping this check silently misses automated review findings
(GH-728). Do NOT proceed to Check 2 until this script runs.

Top-level PR comments (posted via `gh pr comment`, not inline
review threads) are invisible to Check 1's `reviewThreads`
query. Automated reviewers (claude-review, hygiene-review)
post findings as top-level comments with severity markers.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gh-pr-merge/scripts/check-top-level-comments.sh \
  OWNER REPO NUMBER
```

Prefer the MCP wrapper over the raw script:

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__check_top_level_comments(repo="OWNER/REPO", pr_number=NUMBER)
```

The result carries `findings`/`count` plus two severity buckets
(GH-808 F1): `blocking` (findings with a `REQUIRED`/`CRITICAL`/
`BLOCKING` marker) and `needs_disposition` (non-blocking
`INFO`/`NOTE`/`SUGGESTION` findings, incl. those in a
`COMMENTED`/`APPROVED` review **body** that a severity-only scan
used to miss). Both buckets must be clear before this check passes:

- `blocking_count > 0` → hard-block merge; report the count and
  first line of each.
- `needs_disposition_count > 0` → block until each has an explicit
  disposition (address / defer-with-ticket / reply-declining). A
  non-blocking INFO recommendation must not merge silently
  unaddressed — the human reviewer catching it later is the failure
  GH-808 documents.

**Addressed findings are matched by key (GH-907, GH-884).** A finding
(either bucket) is "addressed" when a later comment replies to it with
the finding's **comment id on the `Re:` line** — the documented
`Dev10x:gh-pr-respond` format, `Re: comment <id> — …`. `top-level-comments.jq`
collects every id keyed by a reply and drops those findings from the
result, so the reply satisfies the disposition requirement for a
`needs_disposition` finding just as it clears a `blocking` one, and
`blocking_count` actually returns to 0.

Matching is deliberately keyed rather than prose-fuzzy: an unkeyed
`Re: the footer thing` does NOT clear the gate, and short digit runs
(`GH-907`, `Round 4`) stay under the 6-digit floor so a ticket reference
can never wave a live finding through. The id is read from the raw body,
so wrapping it in backticks is no longer needed to work around a stale
finding. A reply still never counts as a finding itself (GH-777).

**Minimizing a comment does NOT address it (GH-920).** This scan reads
the REST issue-comments array, which carries no `isMinimized` field, so
a `minimizeComment` mutation is invisible here by design.
`Dev10x:gh-pr-respond` Gate 6 hiding is cosmetic noise reduction, not a
disposition. When this check blocks on a finding whose comment is
already hidden, the fix is a keyed `Re:` reply — not another
minimization, and not a merge override.

**Reviewer round-summary wrapper excluded (GH-858 F2).** The
automated reviewer's own `## Review Summary (Round N)` comment
restates already-fixed findings under `### Addressed since last
review`. `top-level-comments.jq` now scans only that comment's
`### Remaining issues` section, so a round summary with no live
remaining issues no longer false-blocks this check. Combined with
the AFK auto-remediation in Check 1, a bot-authored
`needs_disposition` finding under an `auto-advance`
`thread_resolution` gate follows the same auto-delegate-to-
`gh-pr-respond` path rather than forcing a manual merge override.

**Only the latest round is authoritative (GH-873 F3).** When several
`## Review Summary (Round N)` comments exist, `top-level-comments.jq`
now keeps only the highest `Round N` and treats earlier rounds as
superseded — their `### Remaining issues` are a historical snapshot,
not live blockers. So a green final round (Round 4) clears the stale
"remaining issues" that Rounds 1/3 listed at the time, instead of
each historical round independently false-blocking the merge.

**Markup is optional on the wrapper, and sign-offs do not block
(GH-1054 F2).** A summary headline is recognised without `##`/bold
when it numbers itself (`Review Summary (Round 3)` as plain text),
so a bot that skips heading markup still gets latest-round
supersession instead of a stale round blocking forever. Separately,
a severity token inside a negation or confirmation on the same line
— `No CRITICAL issues found`, `All CRITICAL items fully addressed`,
`✅ Fix verified — CRITICAL resolved` — is the reviewer signing off,
not a finding, and no longer blocks. The exempt set is deliberately
narrow: each shape demands an explicit cue (a quantifier, a
past-tense resolution verb, or a checkmark paired with one) beside
the token, because a missed blocker is worse than a false positive
the author can still answer with a keyed `Re:` reply.

### Check 1c: No unaddressed inline review comments (GH-760)

Inline review comments posted via `pulls/{n}/comments` are
invisible to both Check 1 (GraphQL `reviewThreads`) and
Check 1b (`issueComments`). Query them via the MCP wrapper —
never raw `gh api .../pulls/.../comments` (GH-598):

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_comments(pr_number=NUMBER, action="list", unresolved_only=true)
```

Filter for bot users with unaddressed severity markers
(`CRITICAL`, `BLOCKING`, `REQUIRED`). A comment is
addressed if a reply exists (same `in_reply_to_id`).
If unaddressed findings remain, report them and block
merge.

### Check 1d: Fixes-linked issue scope delivered (GH-856)

A `Fixes:`/`Closes:` link auto-closes its issue on merge
regardless of how much of the issue's stated scope the diff
delivers. Checks 1–1c and 2–7 validate only code that is
*present*; nothing compares the linked issue's scope against the
diff. Under session-close pressure a narrower slice merges with
the full-scope `Fixes:` link intact and the issue closes short —
including *self-disclosed* cuts (a PR body or unchecked checklist
noting remaining work), because the link fires on merge
regardless of disclosure.

**Run the deterministic pass first (GH-1241).** The judgment
below is the right instrument for the hard case and the wrong one
for the easy case — and the easy case is what shipped wrong. PR
#1228 declared six links and carried commits for five; GH-1221
closed with no commit behind it at all. A link with *no* commit
mentioning its ticket needs no reasoning, so decide it
mechanically before spending judgment on the rest:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gh-pr-merge/scripts/reconcile-fixes-links.py \
  --body-file <pr-body.txt> --base origin/<base>
```

Write the PR body to a file via `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp`
first. The script prints a JSON verdict on stdout and exits
non-zero when any link is unbacked; `unbacked` names the specific
issues. **Exit 1 blocks the merge** — the link would close an
issue this PR never touched.

For a link deliberately kept without a commit of its own (an
issue delivered by a commit that names a sibling), pass
`--acknowledge <number>`. That is an explicit argument rather
than an inferred exception so a human records the decision;
never widen the regex or drop the link to make the check pass.

Then, for each link the deterministic pass cleared, compare the
linked issue's title + acceptance criteria against the diff
(`git diff origin/<base>..HEAD`). This second pass is a reasoning
judgment, not a shell command — a commit can mention a ticket
without delivering what the ticket titled:

- **Block** when a titled capability is unbuilt — tell-tales:
  new production code with no non-test caller, a titled
  sub-feature (e.g. "aggregate **+ promoteYear mutation**") with
  no corresponding diff, or a review comment / unchecked
  checklist item noting remaining work.
- **Pass** when every titled capability of each linked issue is
  represented in the diff.

On failure, do NOT merge. Recommend one of: drop or narrow the
`Fixes:`/`Closes:` link so the issue stays open for the
undelivered scope, or split the undelivered scope into a tracked
follow-up issue **before** merge and keep the link. This mirrors
the disposition requirement of Checks 1b/1c — an under-delivered
scope must not merge silently.

### Check 2: CI checks passing

```bash
gh pr checks NUMBER --json name,state,bucket
```

All checks must have `bucket` of `pass` — including checks
that are not required by branch protection. No checks may be
`PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`. Report any failing or pending
checks by name.

**`ci_check_status`'s `required_verdict: "empty"` is not a pending
state (GH-1381).** `develop` registers no required status checks
(ADR-0024), so `required_verdict` reads `"empty"` on every green,
mergeable PR — that is where it settles, not a step before
`"green"`. Branch this check on the blended `verdict` field: a green
`verdict` with zero `pending` and zero `fail` clears Check 2
regardless of what `required_verdict` says. Two workers each sat on
a fully-passed PR (#1362 at 7/7, #1360 at 6/6) without merging
because `required_verdict: "empty"` read as "still waiting" —
neither actually was.

**Unattended contexts: prefer the wrapper (GH-1058).** When this
skill runs the merge gate for an unattended harness (the
`Dev10x:foreman` watchdog, an afk session), reach for
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__ci_check_status(wait=false)` instead of
the raw `gh pr checks` above. It returns the same verdict off the
Bash layer, so it cannot raise a permission prompt that nobody is
awake to answer — the failure mode that froze a watchdog mid-night
because a pending prompt records neither a block nor a denial in
the hook logs. Attended sessions may keep the raw form.

`gh-pr-merge` MUST NOT proceed silently past any `PENDING`,
`IN_PROGRESS`, or `bucket: fail` state. The default response
is to stay in the fix-and-monitor loop — not to ask the user.
The user is only consulted when all automated options have
been exhausted or the failure looks unrelated to the PR.

**Pending CI delegation (GH-775, GH-955):** If any check is
`PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`, do NOT poll inline with `sleep`
+ `gh pr checks` and do NOT ask the user. Instead, delegate
to `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` to wait for CI to complete,
then retry the merge validation from Check 1. The monitor
skill handles CI polling reliably; inline sleep loops bypass
these guardrails. A pending check's verdict is by definition
unknown — waiting is the only correct behavior.

**Code-failure auto-fix loop (GH-955):** If a check has
`bucket: fail` and the failure looks caused by the PR's own
changes (e.g., lint, type, test, coverage, formatting), do
NOT ask the user. Delegate to `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` —
its Phase 1 "CI Failure Handling" table maps each failure
type to a fixup strategy (format, type annotations, test
fixes, etc.). The monitor creates fixup commits, pushes,
and re-checks until CI turns green. Retry the merge
validation from Check 1 after the monitor returns.

Only escalate to `AskUserQuestion` when:

1. The failure has exhausted the monitor's fix attempts
   (e.g., 5+ rounds of fixup + re-check with the same check
   still failing), OR
2. The failure matches the infrastructure signals below
   (non-code cause — user judgement required to decide
   whether to merge despite the infra outage).

**Infrastructure failure override (GH-730, ALWAYS_ASK):**
When a check fails with a clear infrastructure cause — the
failure is not the PR's fault and no fixup will resolve it —
fire the user-confirmation gate. Signals include:

- "Credit balance is too low" (API billing / quota outage)
- "OIDC token validation" (auth handshake failure)
- "Resource not accessible by integration" (permissions)
- Repeated identical failures after fixup attempts
  (monitor exhaustion)

Never auto-classify without evidence — if uncertain whether
the failure is code or infra, default to the auto-fix loop
above (safer to attempt a fix than to ask the user
prematurely).

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** in this escalation path:

- Question: "CI check `{check-name}` failed due to what
  looks like an infrastructure issue (`{error-summary}`)
  and the auto-fix loop cannot resolve it. Merge anyway,
  or wait?"
- Options:
  - **Wait (Recommended)** — re-invoke
    `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` to retry CI, then retry
    merge validation from Check 1
  - **Merge anyway** — user MUST supply a reason (free text
    via the `Other` notes field). Record the reason in the
    skill's task metadata
    (`TaskUpdate(taskId, metadata={"merge_override_reason":
    "<user text>", "override_check": "<check-name>",
    "override_state": "<state>"})`) so `Dev10x:skill-audit`
    can surface override patterns later.
  - **Abort** — cancel merge.

The gate fires regardless of session policy — an autonomous
posture governs pacing between skills, it does NOT authorize
silent merges past unresolved CI signal. The narrow scope (only after auto-fix
is exhausted or the failure is clearly infra) keeps the
user out of the loop for routine code fixes while still
requiring human judgement for cases where the agent cannot
safely decide.

### Checks 3, 4, 7: Draft / mergeable / approval (one `pr_get` call)

Raw `gh pr view` is hook-blocked and routes to the MCP wrapper.
`pr_get` now exposes `isDraft`, `mergeable`, `reviewDecision`, and
`reviewRequests` (GH-668), so a single call satisfies Checks 3, 4,
and 7 — read each field from the one response:

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_get(number=NUMBER, repo="OWNER/REPO")
```

### Check 2b: PR not already merged; auto-merge not silently armed (GH-848 F4)

`pr_get` now also returns `state` and `autoMergeRequest` — read both
from the same response before evaluating Checks 3/4/7:

1. **Already merged.** If `state == "MERGED"` (or `mergedAt` is
   non-null), the PR self-merged — almost always because auto-merge
   was armed and CI went green before this gate ran. Do NOT attempt to
   merge again. **Short-circuit to post-merge verification**: confirm
   the merge commit, then hand off to `Dev10x:verify-acc-dod`. Report
   that the merge already happened; the remaining checks are moot.

   **Report `ALREADY MERGED`, never the checklist (GH-1380).** The
   Step 4 nine-item checklist is a claim that those nine checks ran in
   THIS invocation. They did not — the merge preceded them. Emitting it
   here is how two workers came to report a gate the orchestrator had
   run by hand for them. Report instead:

   ```
   ## Pre-Merge Validation — NOT RUN
   ALREADY MERGED: PR #N merged at <mergedAt> by <mergedBy, or
   "an actor the PR state does not name">. This invocation ran no
   pre-merge checks; the gate that governed this merge ran elsewhere.
   ```

   Name the actor when `pr_get` or your own `merge_pr` result carries
   one (`mergedBy`, or `merged_as` per GH-1272), and say plainly that
   it is unnamed when neither does. A guessed actor is the same defect
   in a smaller font.
2. **Auto-merge armed on an open PR.** If `state != "MERGED"` and
   `autoMergeRequest` is non-null, the PR will self-merge the instant
   CI passes — potentially before a deferred human review lands. Surface
   this to the supervisor. When review was deliberately deferred,
   **offer to disable auto-merge** (`gh pr merge --disable-auto NUMBER`,
   routed via the merge wrapper) so the pre-merge checks below actually
   gate the merge. At `adaptive` + `solo-maintainer` (where arming
   auto-merge is the intended terminal), leave it armed and proceed.

This check runs BEFORE Checks 3/4/7 because a merged/armed PR makes
those checks either moot (merged) or racing against the auto-merge
(armed).

**Where armed auto-merge comes from (GH-1107 finding 3).** No Dev10x
path arms it on a created PR: `--auto` is reachable only through
`merge_pr(auto=True)`, which defaults to `False` and is gated by the
Step 5 admin/auto prompt below. `create_pr`, `create-pr.sh`, and
`Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` never pass it. An armed PR therefore came from
outside the plugin — a repo-level setting or a manual `gh pr merge
--auto`.

**That still leaves the gate skippable by timing on a repo with no
required status checks.** With no required checks, GitHub merges the
instant CI settles, which can land between "mark ready" and this
gate — in the run behind this finding, a PR merged before the child
invoked the skill at all, so none of the 9 validations ran for it.
Check 2b then correctly short-circuits to post-merge verification,
but the merge is already done.

Read this as a **repo-configuration** finding, not a skill bug: the
fix is to require at least one status check in branch protection, so
an armed auto-merge waits for something this skill can also see.
Establish it from `ci_check_status`, not from assumption —
`required_verdict: "empty"` with every leg `required: false` is what
an unprotected base looks like.

**Do not re-file this against a repo that has already answered it
(GH-1283).** The answer is a durable record, not a per-session
judgement, so check for one before reporting:

- **Answered, and the rule is live** — `required_verdict` is
  something other than `"empty"`. Nothing to report; a
  `state == "MERGED"` here is a genuine anomaly worth investigating
  on its own terms, not the known gap.
- **Answered, rule not yet applied, or answered as
  deliberately-advisory** — the repo carries an ADR or equivalent
  recording the decision (in this repo,
  [ADR-0024](../../docs/adr/0024-required-status-checks-on-develop.md)).
  Cite it in the post-merge report and move on. Re-raising a recorded
  decision as a fresh finding is the failure mode this paragraph
  exists to stop — it cost a slot in three consecutive bundles.
- **Unanswered** — no such record exists. Report it once, and prefer
  filing the *decision* (which legs are merge-blocking) over filing
  "no required checks", which is a symptom.

In every case where the base is genuinely unprotected, treat a
`state == "MERGED"` at Check 2b as a signal that the gate was
bypassed by timing, and say so in the post-merge report rather than
reporting a clean merge.

### Check 3: PR is not in draft

Read `isDraft` from the `pr_get` response. If `isDraft` is `true`,
report that the PR must be marked ready before merging.

**Re-verify after every push (GH-958).** A force-push can reset a
published PR back to draft, so an earlier successful `pr_ready`
call proves nothing once another push has landed. Never trust a
prior ready call — and never trust a `create_pr(draft=false)`:

1. `pr_ready` must run AFTER the FINAL push, not only at PR
   creation. Any `--force-with-lease` (rebase, amend, groom)
   invalidates the ready state.
2. Read `isDraft` from a FRESH `pr_get` immediately before the
   merge gate; if it is `true`, call `pr_ready` and re-read.

Skipping this costs a rejected merge (`GraphQL: Pull Request is
still a draft`) plus a wasted CI round, because marking ready
re-registers the bot checks.

### Check 4: No merge conflicts

Read `mergeable` from the `pr_get` response. The field must be
`MERGEABLE`. If `CONFLICTING`, report that merge conflicts must be
resolved first.

### Check 5: Working copy is clean

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If output is non-empty, report uncommitted changes that must
be committed or stashed before merging.

### Check 6: No fixup/squash commits remaining

```bash
git log --oneline origin/develop..HEAD
```

Scan commit subjects for `fixup!` or `squash!` prefixes.
If any exist, report that commit history must be groomed
first (via `Dev10x:git-groom`).

### Check 7: Review approval

Read `reviewDecision` from the `pr_get` response (same call as
Checks 3/4). Check that `reviewDecision` is `APPROVED`.

**Solo-maintainer override:** If `solo_maintainer: true` in
config, skip this check entirely. Solo maintainers do not
require external approval.

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Detect PR

Detect the current PR from the branch name via the MCP wrapper
(raw `gh pr view` is hook-blocked):

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_detect(arg="")
```

It returns `PR_NUMBER`, `REPO`, `PR_URL`, and `BRANCH`. If no PR
exists for the current branch, report and stop. (The base branch,
if needed, is available from `pr_get`'s `baseRefName`.)

### Step 2: Load merge strategy config

Read the per-project config file. If it does not exist, use
defaults (`strategy: rebase`, `delete_branch: true`,
`solo_maintainer: false`).

### Step 3: Run all 9 validation checks

**Comment-check ordering (GH-462 F3):** Checks 1, 1b, 1c,
and 1d fetch comment/PR-body state that is time-sensitive —
automated review bots continue posting comments during the CI
window, and the `Fixes:`/`Closes:` links Check 1d reads can be
edited then too, so state read before CI settles is stale. Run
Checks 2–7 first (CI, draft, mergeable, working copy,
fixup, approval). Only after Check 2 confirms CI is green
(all checks `pass`) re-fetch and run Checks 1, 1b, 1c, and 1d
as a final gate immediately before Step 5 merge. This
eliminates the race where a bot posts a REQUIRED finding
after the comment check but before the merge.

Run non-comment checks in parallel where possible (Check 2 uses
`gh pr checks`, Checks 3/4/7 share one `pr_get` MCP call, and
Checks 5/6 use `git`). **Check 1b MUST be run as a
separate step after Check 1** — it calls
`check-top-level-comments.sh` and is NOT part of the
GraphQL batch (GH-728). Collect all results before
reporting.

### Step 4: Report validation results

Present results as a checklist:

```
## Pre-Merge Validation

- [x] No unresolved review threads (0 unresolved)
- [x] No unaddressed automated review comments (0 found)
- [x] Fixes-linked issue scope delivered (2/2 links)
- [x] CI checks passing (12/12 green)
- [x] PR is not in draft
- [x] No merge conflicts (MERGEABLE)
- [x] Working copy is clean
- [x] No fixup/squash commits (8 clean commits)
- [x] Review approved (or solo-maintainer override)
```

If any check fails, show `[ ]` with failure details:

```
- [ ] CI checks passing (2 failing: lint, type-check)
```

### Step 5: Merge or refuse

**Any check fails:** Do NOT merge — skip straight to the "Any
check fails" table below. The merge gate below only applies once
all 9 checks pass.

**All checks pass — resolve the merge gate (ADR-0016, GH-757):**
Call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="merge",
context={})` before executing the merge. Do NOT special-case
`solo_maintainer`, `friction_level`, or `active_modes` in prose
here — the resolver reads session policy (preset + overlays,
including the solo-maintainer overlay) itself.

1. `effect == "ask"` → Fire `AskUserQuestion`:
   - Question: "All 9 pre-merge checks passed for PR #NUMBER.
     Merge now via STRATEGY?"
   - Options: **Merge now (Recommended)** — proceed to the
     `merge_pr` call below / **Abort** — leave the PR open.
2. `effect == "auto-advance"` → Proceed directly to the
   `merge_pr` call below without prompting. Surface the
   returned `record` line in the transcript before merging.
3. `effect == "skip"` → Do NOT merge. Report that gate policy
   for this session hands merges to a human via the PR UI
   (`gh pr merge` from the command line or the GitHub web UI),
   and stop — this is the guided-preset behavior, not a check
   failure.
4. Response has an `error` key → fail safe: treat as `ask` and
   fire the `AskUserQuestion` widget above.

**Executing the merge** (after `ask` is approved or the gate
auto-advances), call the MCP tool (GH-232):

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__merge_pr(
    pr_number=NUMBER,
    strategy="rebase",        # or "squash" / "merge" per config
    delete_branch=True,       # or False per config
    repo="OWNER/REPO",        # auto-detected if omitted
)
```

The `admin` and `auto` parameters default to `false` here — a
normal merge never sets them. They are set ONLY by the
required-review block override below, and only with explicit
user confirmation.

The MCP tool wraps `gh pr merge` inside the MCP server's
subprocess, so the PreToolUse hook that blocks raw `gh pr
merge` Bash invocations does not apply. This is the only
authorized way to execute the merge — do NOT fall back to a
raw `gh pr merge` invocation or any caller-level env-bypass.
Hook overrides for transient MCP unavailability live in the
hook layer (see `.claude/rules/hook-patterns.md`), not at the
skill caller.

The tool returns `{pr_number, url, strategy, branch_deleted,
admin, auto, repo}` on success and `{error: "..."}` on failure.

**Worktree safety (GH-773):** The tool always passes
`--repo OWNER/REPO` to `gh pr merge` (auto-detected when
`repo` is omitted) so it never tries to check out the base
branch locally — required when the base branch is already
checked out in another worktree.

**MCP unavailable fallback:** If the MCP server is
disconnected (`merge_pr` listed as "no longer available" in
system-reminders), STOP and ask the user to reconnect via
`/mcp` or restart the session. Raw `gh pr merge` is blocked
and the SKIP env-var prefix is not the documented contract.

**Required-review block override (GH-733, ALWAYS_ASK):** When
Checks 1–7 pass but the merge cannot land because the PR is
`BLOCKED` by a required-review branch-protection rule the
current account cannot satisfy, `merge_pr` returns an error
containing "base branch policy prohibits the merge" (and `gh`
advises adding `--admin` or `--auto`). This is the canonical
solo-maintainer case — GitHub forbids self-approval, so the
PR can never reach `reviewDecision: APPROVED` on its own. It
is NOT a check failure to route around: the 7 non-approval
checks already passed, and approval (Check 7) is the only
unsatisfiable gate.

Fire this gate **only when `solo_maintainer: true`** in config.
Without solo-maintainer mode, a `BLOCKED` PR means a real
reviewer still owes an approval — do NOT offer an admin bypass;
report the block and stop.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).
This gate is `ALWAYS_ASK` — it fires at every friction level
including `adaptive`+`solo-maintainer`, mirroring the Check-2
infrastructure override. Auto-merging with admin privileges
silently would defeat the gate's purpose.

- Question: "PR #NUMBER passed all checks but is BLOCKED by a
  required-review rule you cannot self-approve. Merge with
  administrator privileges, enable auto-merge, or abort?"
- Options:
  - **Merge with admin override (Recommended)** — re-call
    `merge_pr(pr_number=NUMBER, strategy="...", admin=true,
    repo="OWNER/REPO")`. Record the reason in task metadata:
    `TaskUpdate(taskId, metadata={"merge_override_reason":
    "solo-maintainer required-review block",
    "override_check": "branch-protection",
    "override_state": "BLOCKED"})` so `Dev10x:skill-audit`
    can surface override patterns later.
  - **Enable auto-merge** — re-call
    `merge_pr(pr_number=NUMBER, strategy="...", auto=true,
    repo="OWNER/REPO")`. GitHub queues the merge and lands it
    once branch-protection requirements are met; nothing merges
    immediately. Use when a reviewer is expected to approve
    later.
  - **Abort** — leave the PR open.

Never set `admin=true` or `auto=true` autonomously — only the
user may authorize either path through this gate. The flags
exist so the sanctioned MCP path can complete the merge
instead of forcing a raw `gh api .../merge` admin bypass that
skips the entire 9-check gate.

**Any check fails:** Do NOT merge. Report which checks failed
and what action is needed to resolve each one. Suggest the
appropriate skill for remediation:

| Failed check | Remediation |
|-------------|-------------|
| Unresolved threads | `Dev10x:gh-pr-respond` |
| Unaddressed automated comments | Review and address findings |
| Under-delivered Fixes scope | Narrow the `Fixes:` link or split a follow-up issue |
| CI failing | `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` |
| Still in draft | `gh pr ready` |
| Merge conflicts | Rebase onto base branch |
| Dirty working copy | `Dev10x:git-commit` |
| Fixup commits | `Dev10x:git-groom` |
| No approval | Request review |

### Step 6: Confirm merge

After successful merge, report:

```
PR #NUMBER merged via STRATEGY into BASE_BRANCH.
Remote branch deleted: yes/no
```

## Auto-Advance Behavior

Whether the merge itself pauses for confirmation is decided
once, at Step 5, by `resolve_gate(gate="merge")` — see Step 5
for the branch pattern. This section covers what happens
**after** a successful merge: the calling skill proceeds
immediately to the next step (typically acceptance criteria
verification), with **no checkpoints the resolver did not ask
for**. There is NO confirmation gate after merge: a trailing "PR
merged — ready to verify acceptance?" is a checkpoint nobody
asked for, and is forbidden. The merge is a step in the
no-checkpoints shipping sequence, not a natural stopping point.

If merge fails (e.g., branch protection rules), report the
error and let the calling skill decide how to proceed. A
genuine merge failure is a hard blocker, not a checkpoint —
treat it accordingly.

The ALWAYS_ASK "merge anyway" override (Check 2 failure path)
is the only documented in-skill pause, and only fires when the
auto-fix loop is exhausted. See `references/friction-levels.md`
§ "No checkpoints" rule for the canonical definition.

## Important Notes

- Never merge without running ALL 9 checks first
- Never bypass checks even if "it looks fine" — any `PENDING`,
  `IN_PROGRESS`, or `FAILURE` (required or not) blocks the
  merge. Check 2 handles these by delegating to
  `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` (pending → wait; code failure →
  fixup + re-check). The ALWAYS_ASK gate (GH-955, GH-730)
  only fires when the auto-fix loop is exhausted or the
  failure is clearly infrastructure-related. All
  "Merge anyway" overrides require explicit user
  confirmation via `AskUserQuestion` with a recorded reason.
- The solo-maintainer override only skips check 8 (approval),
  not the other 7 checks
- This skill must NOT be called from background agents
  (`Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` explicitly forbids merge operations)
- Always use `gh pr merge` (not `git merge`) to ensure GitHub
  records the merge event properly
