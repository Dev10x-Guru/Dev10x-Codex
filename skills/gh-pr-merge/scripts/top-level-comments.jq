# A row is returned when it is from an automated reviewer AND carries a
# blocking keyword AND is an active review surface:
#
#   is_bot   — IDENTITY evidence: the account is a bot, a known
#              review-bot login, OR the body embeds an HTML marker
#              (third-party LLM reviewers post under generic CI accounts
#              and self-identify only via an HTML comment, GH-764 F1).
#   blocking — SIGNAL: a REQUIRED/CRITICAL/BLOCKING keyword. Kept
#              separate from identity so a bot's marker-tagged
#              walkthrough (no keyword) is NOT a false merge blocker.
#   active   — skip PENDING (author-visible draft) / DISMISSED reviews;
#              issue comments have no .state and always pass.
#   reply    — the documented gh-pr-respond format for addressing a
#              finding starts with "Re:". A faithful reply quotes the
#              finding's severity token, so scanning its raw body makes
#              the reply self-trigger as a NEW finding (GH-777). Replies
#              are responses, not findings — exclude them, and strip
#              quoted context before scanning everything else. A reply
#              ALSO disposes of the finding it keys to: its "Re:" line
#              carries that finding's comment id, and the keyed finding
#              drops out of the result (GH-907, GH-884).

# had no sanctioned exit. Matching is KEYED, not prose-fuzzy: the documented
# gh-pr-respond reply format embeds the finding's comment id ("Re: comment
# <id> …" / "Re: #<id> …"), so every digit run of 6+ characters on a "Re:" line
# is taken as a disposed-of id. Comment ids are 9-10 digits; ticket refs
# ("GH-907") and round numbers stay well under the floor, so they cannot
# accidentally clear a live finding. The key is scanned from the RAW body, not
# `unquoted`, so backticking the id (the old manual code-span workaround) is no
# longer load-bearing.
#
# Only "Re:" lines carry keys. Widening WHERE such a line may sit (GH-1057)

# The reviewer's own re-review wrapper (references/review-guidelines.md):

# review" section RESTATES already-fixed findings (severity tokens and
# all). Scanning that restated text self-triggers the finding as if it
# were live (GH-858 F2), permanently false-blocking Check 1b. This is the
# reviewer's own aggregate summary, not an author "Re:" reply, so is_reply
# does not catch it.
#
# The "(Round N)" suffix is OPTIONAL (GH-1011). A first review is commonly
# posted as a bare "## Review Summary", and requiring the suffix made such a
# comment fall through to the full-body scan — resurrecting the very
# severity tokens its "Addressed since last review" section restates, even
# after a later round confirmed them fixed. The wrapper is identified by its
# heading, not by whether the reviewer numbered it.
#
# Heading markup is OPTIONAL when the wrapper numbers itself (GH-1054 F2).
# Requiring a leading "##" made a bot that opens with a bare, plain-text
# "Review Summary (Round 3)" line invisible as a wrapper, so the
# latest-round-supersedes logic below never engaged and an earlier round
# kept blocking forever. The markup-free alternative demands the explicit
# "(Round N)" suffix: that suffix is what makes the line a review-round
# wrapper rather than prose that happens to say "review summary", and the
# match is anchored to the start of a line so a mid-sentence mention
# cannot silently narrow the scan.

#
# An unnumbered summary counts as round 1 (GH-1011): it is somebody's first
# pass, so a later "(Round 2)" must supersede it, while on its own it stays
# authoritative (1 >= 1). Non-summary comments stay at 0 so they never
# participate in supersession.
# The round the PR BODY declares, 0 when it declares none (GH-1085).
#
# "Only the latest round is authoritative" (GH-873 F3) was keyed on round
# summary COMMENTS alone. A reviewer whose final round is a checklist
# refresh in the PR body plus an empty-body review posts no new summary
# comment, so the previous round's "Remaining issues" stayed live and its
# INFO findings kept demanding a disposition after the reviewer had
# effectively signed off (observed on Brave-Labs/zebra#2289). The filter
# never saw the body, so the fix was not expressible here at all — the
# caller now passes it as $pr_body.
#
# What counts as a body round marker is deliberately narrow: a line that
# names BOTH a review and a round number. A body that merely mentions
# "round 2" of something else, or reviews without numbering a round,
# declares nothing. Erring narrow keeps a genuinely-live finding blocking,
# which is the direction this gate must fail in.

# For a round summary, scan ONLY the "### Remaining issues" section — the

# yields no scan text and is treated as clean (fail-open) — the same posture
# a fully-addressed round already warrants.
#
# The section ENDS at the next horizontal rule or heading (GH-1011). An
# unbounded `.*` ran to end-of-body, so a summary that said "Remaining
# issues: None" still blocked the merge on a *CRITICAL* token appearing in
# an unrelated later section (a false-positive-drops list). Stopping at the
# boundary keeps the scan inside the section the heading names.
#
# `###` is a terminator as well as `##`, because a sibling `###` section is
# far likelier than a `###` sub-heading nested INSIDE a remaining-issues
# list — findings there are list items directly under the heading. Erring
# this way can only narrow the scan, and a scan that is too narrow
# under-blocks a merge the author is already driving, whereas one that is
# too wide blocks it with no sanctioned exit.
#
# The section heading's own markup is optional for the same reason
# `is_round_summary` no longer demands it (GH-1054 F2): a plain-text wrapper

#
# The pattern set is deliberately NARROW, and stays that way: a false
# negative here lets a genuinely-blocking finding merge, which is strictly
# worse than a false positive the author can still answer with a keyed "Re:"
# reply. So each shape below demands an explicit exoneration cue on the SAME
# line as the token — a quantifier ("no"/"none"/"all"/"every"), a resolution
# verb ("addressed"/"resolved"/"fixed"/"cleared"/"verified"), or a checkmark
# paired with one — rather than any general "sounds positive" heuristic.
# Prose like "CRITICAL: this was previously fine" carries no cue and keeps
# blocking, which is the intended bias.
# The token set spans BOTH severity families (GH-1057). Exoneration cues were
