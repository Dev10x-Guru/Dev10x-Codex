# Create Issue Tracker Ticket

## Overview

This skill creates a well-structured ticket in GitHub Issues, Linear, or JIRA with proper formatting, comprehensive description, and appropriate labels. It ensures consistent ticket quality across all creation contexts.

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.
Create a task at invocation, mark completed when done:

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Create issue tracker ticket", activeForm="Creating ticket")`

Mark completed when done: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`

## Prerequisites Check

Determine which tracker to use. Priority:

1. **Explicit argument** — user specifies `--github`, `--linear`, or `--jira`
2. **detect_tracker MCP tool** — if a ticket prefix is available (from branch
   name), call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker` to match the project's
   tracker
3. **Repo default** — if no prefix, check autolinks to determine project's
   primary tracker. GitHub Issues if no autolinks exist.

**Fast-fail rule:** Make ONE attempt at the `detect_tracker` MCP call.
If the tool is unavailable, returns an error, or `ToolSearch` does not
surface it on the first lookup, fall through to step 3 (repo default)
immediately. Do NOT retry `ToolSearch` for Linear, JIRA, or
`detect_tracker` MCP names. Repeated retries block the skill for
many minutes and produce no new information — the absence of a tool
on the first lookup means it is not registered in this session.

| Tracker | Required | Creation method |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| GitHub | `gh` CLI | `gh issue create` |
| Linear | Linear MCP | `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__save_issue` |
| JIRA | Atlassian MCP | `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__createJiraIssue` |

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a ticket for tech debt that needs tracking
- Converting an untracked change into a formal ticket
- Creating a bug report ticket
- Documenting an improvement or enhancement
- Need a properly structured ticket with consistent formatting

### Anti-pattern: Bypassing the wrapper (GH-156)

**Do NOT call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_create` (or any
tracker MCP `save_issue` / `gh issue create`) directly when
creating a new ticket.** Audit GH-156 caught 5 follow-up tickets
created via raw `issue_create` calls; the resulting tickets
lacked the Root Cause / Solution / Files Changed scaffolding
that this skill enforces.

The raw MCP tool is a low-level primitive — this skill is the
project wrapper that adds structured description formatting,
milestone/label triage, and tracker-detection. Always reach for
`Skill(Dev10x:ticket-create)` first; the skill's Step 5 will
dispatch the appropriate MCP tool internally.

**This binds every filing path (GH-1102).** `Dev10x:audit-file`,
`Dev10x:work-on` follow-up filing, `Dev10x:diag-friction` upstream
filing, and `Dev10x:foreman` crew filing all route here rather than
calling `issue_create` bare — otherwise each one re-invents (or
skips) Step 4 and the backlog goes back to needing sweeps. A caller
that already knows the milestone and labels still routes through
this skill and passes them; it does not become its own filing path.

## Input Requirements

This skill requires:
1. **Context** - Information about the problem/improvement (can be from a commit, code analysis, or user description)
2. **Optional: Title** - If not provided, generate from context.
   When `--body-file` is used without `--title`, the first line
   of the file is used as the title (separated from the body by
   a blank line). This avoids permission friction from special
   characters in args strings.
3. **Optional: Labels** - If not provided, infer from context

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Context

Understand what the ticket is about from the provided context:

**Context can come from:**
- Git commit diff and message (`git show <commit-hash>`)
- Code files that need improvement
- User description of the problem
- Bug report or issue description

**Extract:**
- What problem is being solved?
- Why did the issue exist?
- What changes were/will be made?
- What files are affected?

### Step 2: Generate Ticket Title

Create a descriptive, concise title following these patterns:

**Title Format Patterns:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Tech debt | "Fix tech debt in..." | "Fix tech debt in TestAddTireService flaky tests" |
| Bug fix | "Fix bug in..." | "Fix bug in payment processing timeout handling" |
| Enhancement | "Improve..." | "Improve customer search performance" |
| Refactoring | "Refactor..." | "Refactor invoice generation service" |
| Test improvement | "Fix flaky test in..." | "Fix flaky test in work order creation" |
| Missing feature | "Add..." | "Add retry mechanism for Square API" |

**Title Rules:**
- Keep concise but descriptive (aim for < 80 characters)
- Start with action verb (Fix, Improve, Add, Refactor, etc.)
- Be specific about the component/area affected
- Avoid vague terms like "issue" or "problem" without context
- **Describe the user-facing outcome, not the implementation detail.** E.g., `Enable automatic terminal discovery` not `Add DEVICES_READ to Square OAuth scopes`

### Step 3: Generate Description

Create a comprehensive description using this structure:

**Structure:**
```markdown
<Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the problem/improvement>

## Root Cause
- <Primary reason the issue existed>
- <Contributing factors>
- <Technical details about why this happened>

## Solution
- <First key change or improvement>
- <Second key change or improvement>
- <Third key change or improvement>
- <Additional changes as needed>

## Files Changed
- <file path 1> - <what changed>
- <file path 2> - <what changed>
- <file path 3> - <what changed>
```

### Step 4: Triage Milestone and Labels (GH-1102)

**REQUIRED — never file bare.** The filing tools accept `milestone`
and `labels`, but until GH-1102 no filing flow populated them: a
2026-08-30 sweep found 11 of 16 open issues unmilestoned and 10 of 13
unlabeled, every one filed through these wrappers. The taxonomy and
the milestone convention both exist; filing simply ignored them, and
the cost landed on periodic manual restructure sweeps.

**Step 4a — read the live roster.** Call
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__triage_roster(repo="$REPO")`. It returns
`milestones` (open only, with descriptions) and `labels` (name +
description). Do NOT work from a hardcoded list — a stale table is
how the taxonomy drifted out of use in the first place.

**Step 4b — propose labels.** Match the ticket's title and body
against the returned roster:

| Signal in the ticket | Label to propose |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Names a skill (`Dev10x:fanout`, `gh-pr-create`, …) | the matching `skill:*` label |
| Permission prompt / allow-rule gap | `permission-friction` |
| Error swallowed or surfaced without diagnostics | `silent-failure` |
| Raw git/gh used where a wrapper is required | `routing-bypass` |
| Umbrella issue spanning milestones | `tracker` |
| New capability | `enhancement` |
| Incorrect behavior | `bug` |

Propose every label whose signal is present — labels are not
exclusive. When the roster contains a label this table does not
mention, prefer the roster: its description states its purpose.

**Step 4c — propose a milestone.** Match the ticket's theme against
the open milestones' titles and descriptions, respecting the
initiative prefixes and close-at-zero lifecycle in
[`references/milestone-naming.md`](../../references/milestone-naming.md).
A milestone whose description already names this ticket's theme is a
direct hit.

**Step 4d — when nothing fits, say so explicitly.** If no open
milestone is a confident match, file with the `needs-triage` label
rather than silently unmilestoned, so a later sweep can find strays
with one query instead of reading every bare issue. Never leave BOTH
milestone and labels empty — that is the state this step exists to
prevent.

**Attended mode:** present the proposal at the Step 5 confirmation
so the user can adjust it. **Unattended mode:** apply the best match
and proceed — filing bare is not the safe default here, it is the
defect.

### Step 5: Create the Ticket

**REQUIRED: Dispatch a background haiku agent to create the ticket.**
Execute this `Agent` call (do NOT inline ticket creation in the main
session). This prevents raw API responses (full issue JSON, project
lookups) from consuming main session context — the agent returns only
the ticket ID and URL.

1. `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="haiku", description="Create {tracker} ticket: {short_title}", prompt="<see template below>", run_in_background=true)`

The agent prompt template (substitute placeholders before dispatching):

```
Create a ticket with the following details:

Tracker: {tracker_type}
Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Labels: {labels}
Milestone: {milestone}
{tracker-specific config: team UUID, project UUID, repo}

The Labels and Milestone above come from the Step 4 triage and are
part of the creation call — do NOT file without them and leave
triage to a later sweep (GH-1102).

{include the tracker-specific instructions below}

Return ONLY:
- Tracker: {GitHub Issues | Linear | JIRA}
- ID: {ticket ID}
- URL: {ticket URL}
Do NOT return full API response bodies.
```

The main session waits for the agent result and passes it to
Step 6. The tracker-specific instructions below describe what
the agent executes — include the relevant section in the agent's
prompt (the fenced blocks under each tracker are reference material
for the dispatched agent, not instructions for the main session).

**Exception — inline creation is acceptable** when follow-on calls
need the returned ticket key immediately (e.g. a small batch where
`createIssueLink` needs the just-created issues' keys). Create the
ticket directly in the main session instead of dispatching the
background agent, so the key is available for the next call without
a round trip.

**Secondary fallback:** if JIRA writes are prompting for approval
because the `mcp-atlassian-write` baseline group has not synced to
your `settings.json` (see the troubleshooting note under the JIRA
section below), create inline too — a background agent cannot
answer that prompt. Prefer fixing the sync gap via
`Dev10x:plugin-maintenance` over leaning on this fallback long-term.

**Nested invocation:** When invoked from a background agent
(e.g., from `project-scope`'s Phase 3 agent), skip the
delegation wrapper and execute creation directly. Detection:
if the skill is running as a Skill() call within an Agent()
prompt (vs. in main session), this SKILL.md is your read
context — your caller (the agent prompt) already optimizes
the session context, so you execute creation directly per
tracker-specific instructions below without wrapping in
Agent().

**Tracker-specific creation instructions:**

Dispatch to the detected tracker:

**GitHub Issues:**

Write the description to a temp file first (inline `--body` strings
break shell quoting on markdown tables and long descriptions):
```bash
# Generate temp path via mktmp.sh, then write body via Write tool
BODY_FILE=$(/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh gh-issue body .md)
# Write description content to $BODY_FILE via the Write tool
gh issue create --repo "$REPO" --title "$TITLE" --body-file "$BODY_FILE" --label "$LABELS" --milestone "$MILESTONE"
```

Omit `--milestone` only when Step 4d found no confident match — in
which case `$LABELS` carries `needs-triage`.

**Title-in-file convention:** When the caller provides
`--body-file` without `--title`, use the wrapper script that
reads line 1 as the title and creates the issue in one call
(like `git commit -F`):
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ticket-create/scripts/create-github-issue.sh "$BODY_FILE" "$REPO" "$LABELS"
```
This avoids passing titles with special characters in args
strings, which can cause permission friction.

**Linear:**

If a `project` parameter was provided by the caller, resolve the
project UUID first via `list_projects(team: "TEAM_UUID")` — never
pass a display name (name matching is exact and fails silently).
After creation, verify linkage with `get_issue(id)` and confirm
`projectId` matches the expected UUID. See `Dev10x:linear`
§ Project Assignment.

```
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__save_issue(
    team: "TEAM_UUID",
    title: TITLE,
    description: DESCRIPTION,
    labels: [LABELS],
    project: "PROJECT_UUID"  # optional — resolved UUID only
)
```

**JIRA:**

Create via the Atlassian MCP `createJiraIssue` tool, mirroring the
GitHub/Linear branches above. The `Dev10x:jira` skill ships only
read / search / update / comment / link scripts — it has **no create
path** — so the Atlassian MCP is the JIRA-creation surface (GH-631):

```
mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__createJiraIssue(
    cloudId: <from getAccessibleAtlassianResources>,
    projectKey: <from getVisibleJiraProjects>,
    issueTypeName: <Task | Bug — from getJiraProjectIssueTypesMetadata>,
    summary: TITLE,
    description: DESCRIPTION,
)
```

Resolve `cloudId`, `projectKey`, and the issue-type name via the
read-only Atlassian tools (all pre-approved) before the create call;
use the live tool schema for exact field names.

The Atlassian ticket-management **write** tools (`createJiraIssue`,
`editJiraIssue`, `addCommentToJiraIssue`, `transitionJiraIssue`,
`createIssueLink`, …) **are** pre-approved via the
`mcp-atlassian-write` baseline permission group (GH-631). This
deliberately overrides the GH-593 write-precedence default, so the
Step 5 background creation agent can call `createJiraIssue`
unattended without stalling on a permission prompt.

**Troubleshooting (GH-899):** if these writes still prompt for
approval, the `mcp-atlassian-write` baseline group has not reached
your live `settings.json` yet — that is a seed/sync gap, not the
intended design. Re-apply base permissions with
`Dev10x:plugin-maintenance` (or run `Dev10x:upgrade-cleanup`, which
invokes it in full mode), then retry. See Step 5's inline-creation
exception for a stopgap while the sync gap persists.

> Team-specific IDs are documented in the tracker skill (`Dev10x:linear`, `Dev10x:jira`).

### Step 6: Return Ticket Information

Extract and return the ticket details:

```
Ticket Created

Tracker: {GitHub Issues | Linear | JIRA}
ID: {GH-42 | PAY-519 | JIRA-1234}
Title: {title}
URL: {tracker-specific URL}
```

## Important Notes

- Keep titles concise but descriptive
- Always include Root Cause, Solution, and Files Changed sections
- Apply relevant labels to improve discoverability
- Return the ticket ID for use in subsequent workflows
- Don't modify ticket after creation unless explicitly asked
