# DDD Event Storming Workshop

Guide users through structured domain exploration using DDD Event
Storming, Software Archetypes, and architecture stress testing.

## When to Use

**Trigger on:** starting or continuing a domain modeling session,
exploring a new feature area, stress-testing the architecture,
applying/recognizing a Software Archetype, scoping a feature that
crosses bounded context boundaries, or resolving an implementation
contradiction.

**Do NOT use for:** scoping a single well-defined ticket (use
`ticket-scope`), writing an ADR for an already-decided topic (use
`write-adr`), or pure implementation tasks with no domain questions.

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.

**Auto-advance:** Complete each step, immediately start the next — no checkpoints the resolver did not ask for.
Only pause when batching questions per the process rules.

**REQUIRED: Create tasks before ANY work.** After determining the
session type (see `references/session-modes.md` § Determine Session
Type), execute the `TaskCreate` calls for the applicable mode —
**Continue / Stress-Test / Archetype** or **New workshop**. Both
share the same 6-step shape (load-or-scaffold, explore, stress-test,
decide, produce artifacts, quality checklist); full per-mode call
lists live in `references/session-modes.md` § Per-Mode Task Lists.
Set sequential dependencies; mark each step `in_progress` on start
and `completed` when done. Quality checklist is the final gate.

## Determine Session Type

Before starting, read `references/session-modes.md` § Determine
Session Type for the full mode-trigger table (new workshop /
continue / stress test / archetype) and the solo-vs-multi-participant
default.

### Discussion-Agent Model Tier (solo mode)

Discussion agents (persona panel + devil's advocate) perform
judgment work — their entire output IS the discussion, so the
cost-tiering rationale for fetch/prep agents does not apply (GH-789).

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text) ONCE
per session before the first AI-cast dispatch, batched with the
persona-selection confirmation (`references/solo-facilitation.md`
§ Selecting personas — never as a standalone interruption). Options:
**Frontier (Recommended)** — omit `model:` so agents inherit the
session default; **Sonnet** — budget middle ground; **Haiku** —
quick smoke-run only (warn: naive output, no interaction-level
thinking).

Persist the choice for the whole session and use it for BOTH
persona rounds (blind generation + stress-test round) AND the
devil's advocate. See `references/solo-facilitation.md`
§ Cost & Cadence Defaults.

---

## Step 1: Load Context (Continue/Stress-Test modes)

Read these files **in this order** before proceeding: `model.md`
(current domain model), `decisions.md` (append-only prior
decisions), `calculator.md` (calculation formulas, if present),
`stress-tests.md` (validated architectural seams), `glossary.md`
(ubiquitous language), `epics.md` (tickets and priorities), and the
latest file in `workshops/` (previous session). Then read
implementation state: the project's domain source directory
(locate via CLAUDE.md or glob for the model types named in
`model.md`), and `CLAUDE.md` (project conventions).

**Summarize** what you understand in 3-5 sentences before proceeding.

For **new workshops**, skip to `references/session-modes.md` §
New Workshop: Scaffolding, then proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Process Rules

Read `references/process-rules.md` for the full set.

- **Minimize interruptions** — go as long as possible without
  asking questions. Make reasonable assumptions, note alternatives,
  store unresolved choices. Only stop when the choice is genuinely
  arbitrary or high-stakes. When you DO need input, **batch ALL
  questions into a single structured decision menu** — never one
  question at a time.
- **Protect accumulated decisions** — never re-derive or silently
  override a decision in `decisions.md`. If new info contradicts a
  prior decision, propose a NEW decision that explicitly supersedes
  it (state which, why, what changes downstream). Reference
  decisions by ID: `[D-NNN]`.
- **Genericize proprietary data** — use reference materials
  (spreadsheets, specs) as behavioral models. Replace proprietary
  specifics with generic examples. The domain model must never leak
  client IP.

---

## Step 3: Exploration

Read `references/exploration-methodology.md` for DDD techniques.

### Event Storming Flow

In solo mode, run layers 1–4 with the persona panel's blind
generation protocol (`references/solo-facilitation.md`): elicit the
human's events first, dispatch personas in parallel, present the
overlap analysis as one batched menu.

1. **Identify domain events** — what happens in the system? (orange)
2. **Identify commands** — what triggers each event? (blue)
3. **Identify actors** — who issues each command? (yellow)
4. **Identify policies** — what rules fire after events? (lilac)
5. **Identify aggregates** — what data clusters together?
6. **Identify bounded contexts** — where are the seams?
7. **Identify value objects** — what are the typed quantities?

### Cross-Reference Checks

At each exploration layer, cross-check four references:

- `../../references/domain/archetypes-catalog.md` — at every stage,
  check whether this problem matches a known Software Archetype
  (21-signal recognition table). **Applying an archetype is NOT
  premature abstraction** — it's recognizing a solved problem; the
  archetype provides vocabulary and structure, the domain provides
  the specific rules.
- `../../references/domain/design-patterns.md` — tactical/strategic pattern
  selection (aggregate rules, context mapping ladder, when NOT to
  CQRS/ES) and workshop-method guidance
- `../../references/domain/anti-patterns.md` — detection signals per workshop
  stage; the devil's advocate agent uses this catalog
- `../../references/domain/standards-and-references.md` — before inventing a
  vocabulary, check whether an industry standard settled it
  (Money → ISO 4217, recurrence → RFC 5545 RRULE, supply-chain
  events → EPCIS, banking contexts → BIAN)

### Integration & Topology Probe (guided)

Once bounded contexts are named (layer 6) and someone asks
"separate services?", run
`../../references/domain/integration-patterns.md`: decide modular
monolith vs split *per context*, check every boundary against the
leak table ("could the other side change its internals without us
noticing?"), and fill one contract line **per context-map edge**
(style, artifact, pattern). Record topology and per-edge choices as
`[D-NNN]` decisions.

### Authorization Probe (guided)

When actors multiply, commands become identity-dependent, or
"role"/"owner"/"visibility" enter the language, run the guided
authorization section in `../../references/domain/authz-patterns.md`:
classify each guarded command's grant sentence into **RBAC / ABAC /
ReBAC / Capability** (bearer invitation for accountless actors —
ask forwardability, scope, expiry, redemption-identity), place the
five policy-architecture boxes (PEP, PDP, PIP, PRP, PAP) on the
context map, and record the model + engine choice as a `[D-NNN]`
decision. Rule: invariants ≠ permissions — permission checks live at
the PEP, never inside aggregates.

### Design Philosophy

These principles govern all proposals made during exploration — see
[`references/exploration-methodology.md`](references/exploration-methodology.md)
§ Design Philosophy for the full set ("don't make me think",
configuration vs. estimation, foundation-ready hooks, deferred
server dependencies).

---

## Step 4: Stress Testing

Before committing to any model change, validate it. Read
`references/stress-test-protocol.md` for the full protocol.

In solo mode, dispatch the devil's advocate before decision
capture on structural changes, and collect one "what if" scenario
per persona (`references/solo-facilitation.md`).

### Quick stress-test checklist

1. **Trace through every pipeline stage** — ZERO changes / additive
   / breaking, per stage.
2. **Check the stable core** — verify `stress-tests.md` "Stable
   Core" components remain stable.
3. **Identify seams** — hook missing? Assess cost now vs. deferred.
4. **Check against prior decisions** — conflicts with `decisions.md`?
5. **Endgame scale test** — airport scale? (10-year project, 5000
   items, 50 departments, mixed product types, multi-currency,
   hierarchical policy)

---

## Step 5: Decision Capture

Every choice gets recorded. Read
`references/session-deliverables.md` for the full format.

### Decision format

See `references/session-deliverables.md` § Decision Log Entries for
the full `D-NNN` template. To supersede: add a new decision with
`supersedes: D-NNN`, update the old entry's status to `Superseded by
D-NNN`.

---

## Step 6: Produce Artifacts

Read `references/session-deliverables.md` for complete format and
`references/document-structure.md` for file responsibilities.

**Always produce:** new entries in `decisions.md` (every choice,
even "decided not to do X") and a workshop record in
`workshops/NNN-topic.md` (narrative, decisions, model changes, open
questions).

**When applicable:** updated `model.md`, `calculator.md`,
`epics.md`, `glossary.md`; a new `stress-tests.md` scenario; new
Claude CLI prompts in `docs/prompts/` when a feature area is fully
scoped. New tickets divide into **configuration** and **estimation**
tickets — each needs a JTBD Job Story, scope, acceptance criteria,
dependencies (see `epics.md`).

**Optional presentation:** for a long workshop record, or a decision
whose alternatives are easier to weigh side by side, consider also
rendering it as an HTML artifact — see
[`../../references/html-artifact-reporting.md`](../../references/html-artifact-reporting.md).
Optional, never a gate: the markdown deliverables above remain the
durable record and the quality checklist passes without an artifact.
