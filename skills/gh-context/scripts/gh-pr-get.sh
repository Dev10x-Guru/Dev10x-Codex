# gh-pr-get.sh — Fetch GitHub PR details as JSON (GH-267).
#
# Usage:
#   gh-pr-get.sh NUMBER [REPO]
#
# If REPO is omitted, detects from current directory.
#
# Output: JSON with number, title, body, state, baseRefName, headRefName,
# mergedAt, closedAt, labels, milestone, assignees, author, url, isDraft,
# mergeable, reviewDecision, reviewRequests, autoMergeRequest, reviews,
# headRefOid, files.
# files (GH-1265) carries the complete changed-file list. Without it callers
# hand-rolled `gh api repos/.../pulls/N/files`, whose 30-item default page
# truncated a 41-file PR and produced a false-negative merge gate. This field
# is GraphQL-backed, so it is not subject to that REST page size.
# Note: ``merged`` is not a valid gh pr view field (GH-329); use mergedAt.
# The isDraft/mergeable/reviewDecision/reviewRequests fields (GH-668) make
# pr_get a drop-in for the hook-blocked ``gh pr view --json ...`` checks in
# Dev10x:gh-pr-merge (Checks 3/4/7) and Dev10x:verify-acc-dod.
# autoMergeRequest (GH-848 F4) is null unless auto-merge is armed; the merge
# gate reads it to detect a PR that will self-merge on green before its
# pre-merge checks run.
# reviews + headRefOid (GH-917) let the review-request skills tell a human
# approval on the current HEAD from a stale or bot one without dropping to
# the hook-blocked raw ``gh pr view``.
#
# Field-set resilience (GH-931 finding 4): the field list grows as newer gh
# releases expose more of the GraphQL schema, so an older gh build rejects the
# whole call with `Unknown JSON field: "..."`. Because raw ``gh pr view`` is
# hook-blocked in favour of this wrapper, that left no working path at all —
# the block message, the replacement, and the skip-flag warning together
# pointed nowhere. Instead of failing, drop the field gh names in its own
# error and retry, so an old gh yields a payload missing only the fields it
# cannot serve. A consumer treats an absent optional key the same as a null
# one (e.g. absent autoMergeRequest == auto-merge not armed).
