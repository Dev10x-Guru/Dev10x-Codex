# Ticket Scope — Linear Ticket Scoping Skill (Instructions)

## Overview

This skill creates comprehensive technical scoping documents for Linear tickets. It extends the base `scope` skill with Linear-specific workflows.

**Use when:**
- Preparing to implement a Linear ticket
- Need technical design before coding
- Want to document approach for a ticket
- Creating detailed implementation plan

**Do NOT use for:**
- Architectural decisions (use `Dev10x:adr` instead)
- Simple bug fixes with obvious solutions
- Quick tasks under 1 story point

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns
(Tier: Standard). It extends the base `scope` skill's orchestration
with Linear-specific tasks.

**Auto-advance:** Complete each phase and immediately start the next — no checkpoints the resolver did not ask for.
Never pause between phases to ask "should I continue?".

**REQUIRED: Create tasks before ANY work.** Execute these
`TaskCreate` calls at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Fetch Linear ticket context", activeForm="Fetching ticket")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Research technical context", activeForm="Researching codebase")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Design solution architecture", activeForm="Designing solution")`
4. `TaskCreate(subject="Estimate complexity and draft Job Story", activeForm="Estimating complexity")`
5. `TaskCreate(subject="Format and present scoping document", activeForm="Formatting scope")`
6. `TaskCreate(subject="Save and update Linear", activeForm="Saving scope")`

Set sequential dependencies: research blocked by fetch, design
blocked by research, estimate blocked by design, format blocked by
estimate, save blocked by format.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text, call spec: [ask-scope-approval.md](./tool-calls/ask-scope-approval.md)) after
presenting the scope. This blocks execution until the user responds.
Options:
- Approve (Recommended) — Save document and optionally update Linear
- Revise — I have corrections to the scope
- More research needed — Need to explore additional areas
- Run PoC — Validate unverified architectural claims via a live
  proof-of-concept before approving (e.g., `claude -p` subprocesses,
  small scripts, or codebase probes that confirm a claim the scope
  depends on)

**When to surface "Run PoC":** Whenever the scope contains claims
the agent could not verify by reading the codebase alone (e.g.,
"approach X loads the plugin in a child session", "tool Y
propagates env vars to subprocesses"). Listing the option
short-circuits the manual escalation pattern observed in audit
session 1d53f6ec — the user otherwise has to invent the PoC step
themselves under "More research needed" (GH-33).

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Linear ticket ID (e.g., PAY-329)

**Optional:**
- External documentation URLs to research
- Specific areas of codebase to explore

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Ticket Context

#### 1.1 Fetch Ticket Details

```
Use Linear MCP to get ticket:
- Title
- Description
- Labels
- Assignee
- Related tickets
- Comments
```

#### 1.2 Check for Existing Context

Look for:
- Related tickets (blocks, blocked by, related to)
- Existing scoping documents
- Previous comments with context
- Attachments or links

#### 1.2a Detect Slack Forwards (GH-218)

When a Slack thread URL is part of the input context, after the
`slack_read_thread` fetch, pass the parent message body and reply
count to `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__slack_thread_is_forward`. The
tool returns `is_forward`, `confidence`, `signals`, and any
extracted `upstream_hints` (external URLs found in the parent).

When `confidence` is `high` or `medium`, the parent message is
likely a forward / cross-post of an upstream thread that holds the
real context. Do NOT silently consume it as canonical source.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).
Options:
- Provide upstream Slack URL (Recommended) — supervisor pastes
  the upstream thread URL; restart Phase 1.1 with it
- Continue with current thread anyway — the thin parent is
  intentional; proceed to Phase 2 with what we have
- Abort scope — supervisor needs to gather more context first

When `confidence` is `low`, proceed normally to Phase 2.

The heuristic itself lives in the MCP tool, not in this document
— sibling skills (`Dev10x:investigate`, `Dev10x:ticket-create`,
`Dev10x:work-on`) that ingest Slack URLs should call the same
tool rather than re-implement the logic.

### Phase 2: Technical Research (Uses base scope skill)

Follow the base `scope` skill for:

1. **Research external resources** (if provided)
2. **Explore existing codebase**
   - Find related patterns
   - Identify reusable components
3. **Identify components** (existing vs. new)

**Tool routing rules during research (GH-55 F6, F7, F8):**

| Goal | Use | Do NOT use |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Search code by pattern/keyword | `Grep` tool with `output_mode: count` or `head_limit` | Bash `grep -rn ... \| head` or `grep \| wc -l` |
| Read a file or excerpt | `Read` tool (with `offset`/`limit` for excerpts) | Bash `cat`, `head`, `tail` |
| Combine setup + search | Two separate Bash calls | `cat ... && grep ...` or `;`-chained shells |
| Create a temp file path | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp` | `/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh` (bash fallback) |

The bash forms are blocked by security hooks (heredoc/redirect
checks, chained commands) or trip Claude's prefix-matching allow
rules. The Grep/Read tools are also faster — they stream results
without spawning a shell. The audit caught six bash `grep`
invocations and three `cat`-based commands hitting the hook
across one ticket-scope research phase; CLAUDE.md §2 already
prohibits these but the rule needs to live next to the work,
not only at the global level.

### Phase 3: Design Solution

#### 3.1 Determine Task Type

**Business Feature** - User-facing functionality
- Requires acceptance criteria
- May need release notes

**Technical Task** - Infrastructure/refactoring
- Technical depth only
- No user-facing changes

**Bug Fix** - Fixing broken behavior
- Root cause analysis
- Resolution summary

#### 3.2 Apply Design Principles

From base `scope` skill:
- YAGNI
- Follow existing patterns
- Clean Architecture

#### 3.3 Create Implementation Plan

Order steps by dependencies:
1. Types/DTOs
2. Client/Repository layer
3. Service layer
4. API layer
5. Tests

### Phase 4: Estimate Complexity

#### Story Points (Fibonacci)

| Points | Complexity | Duration |
|--------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Trivial | Hours |
| 2 | Small | < 1 day |
| 3 | Medium | 1-2 days |
| 5 | Large | 2-3 days |
| 8 | Complex | 3-5 days |
| 13 | Epic-sized | Should be split |

#### Estimation Factors

- New patterns vs. following existing
- Database migrations
- External dependencies
- Test complexity
- Review/iteration cycles

### Phase 4b: Draft Job Story

After estimating complexity, draft a Job Story for the ticket using the JTBD framework. This captures the business "why" early — before implementation begins — and will later be used in the PR description and release notes.

**REQUIRED: Call `Skill(Dev10x:jtbd)` in attended mode** (do NOT
draft the Job Story inline as prose inside the scope document).
Inline drafting bypasses jtbd's own context-gathering and
approval gate and breaks reusable orchestration (GH-27).

1. Pass the ticket context already gathered in Phase 1 (ticket
   details, parent ticket, related tickets) via the `context`
   parameter to avoid redundant API calls
2. The `Dev10x:jtbd` skill handles: situation identification,
   drafting, and user approval
3. Include the approved Job Story (the string returned by the
   skill) in the scoping document under a `## Job Story` section
   right after the title

**Anti-pattern (GH-27):** Writing a Job Story sentence directly
into the scope document Write call without a preceding
`Skill(Dev10x:jtbd)` invocation. Even when the resulting story
reads correctly, the skipped delegation is a compliance
violation — the jtbd skill's own attended-mode approval gate
must fire.

**Do NOT update the Linear ticket description at this point** — the story is saved in the scoping document and will be applied to the PR later via `Dev10x:ticket-jtbd` or `Dev10x:gh-pr-create`.

### Phase 5: Format Scoping Document

#### 5.1 Select Template

**REQUIRED: Read one of the three templates and use its
section structure.** Do NOT hand-craft the scope document
without consulting a template — different sessions produce
different shapes, breaking downstream consumers (PR creation,
project audit) that expect template-stable section names
(GH-28).

Pick by task type and `Read` the corresponding file before
writing the scope document:

- Business Feature → `references/business-feature-template.md`
- Technical Task → `references/technical-task-template.md`
- Bug Fix → `references/bug-fix-template.md`

**Verification:** Before the Phase 5.2 Write call that creates
the scope document, confirm the section headings match the
template's headings exactly (Job Story, Objective, Technical
Approach, Architecture, …). If a heading is missing or
renamed, you skipped the template — go back and read it.

**Anti-pattern (GH-28):** Writing
`/tmp/Dev10x/ticket-scope/<ID>-scope.md` with custom section
names ("Findings", "Approach Notes", etc.) instead of the
template's section names. Even when the content is correct,
the diverged structure breaks audits and PR generation.

#### 5.2 Complete All Sections

**Required sections:**
- Objective/Problem Statement
- Technical Approach
- Architecture (components, dependencies)
- **Entities** (property + relationship schemas — REASONS)
- Implementation Steps (with file paths)
- Code References
- Dependencies (tickets)
- Acceptance Criteria
- **Norms** (project rules — populated by autopopulator, REASONS)
- **Safeguards** (invariants & validation, distinct from Risks —
  REASONS)
- Risks and Mitigations (rollout-only failures)
- Story Points

**REASONS coverage check:** The seven SPDD REASONS dimensions are
Requirements, Approach, Structure, Operations, Entities, Norms,
Safeguards. Map them to template sections:

| REASONS dimension | Template section(s) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Requirements | Objective / Problem Statement / Acceptance Criteria |
| Approach | Technical Approach |
| Structure | Architecture |
| Operations | Implementation Steps / Rollout |
| Entities | **Entities** (new) |
| Norms | **Norms** (new, autopopulator-driven) |
| Safeguards | **Safeguards** (new) |

If a saved scope is missing any of the three new headings, the
spec is incomplete — `Dev10x:spec-sync` will flag it as drift.

#### 5.3 Invoke the Norms / Safeguards Autopopulator (GH-170)

Before writing the scope document, render the Norms and
Safeguards section bodies from `.claude/rules/INDEX.md` and
inject them inline. **Render at generation time, not at
scope-save time** — re-render whenever the spec is fed back
into a generation prompt so stale rule text never lies.

Use the `dev10x.scope` Python API:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from dev10x.scope import render_norms, render_safeguards

affected = [
    "src/payments/square/orders.py",
    "src/payments/square/tests/test_orders.py",
]

norms_md = render_norms(
    affected_files=affected,
    index_path=Path(".claude/rules/INDEX.md"),
)
safeguards_md = render_safeguards(
    affected_files=affected,
    index_path=Path(".claude/rules/INDEX.md"),
    claude_md_path=Path("CLAUDE.md"),
    settings_paths=[
        Path(".claude/settings.local.json"),
        Path(".claude/settings.json"),
    ],
)
```

Inject `norms_md` directly under the `## Norms` heading and
`safeguards_md` directly under the `## Safeguards` heading,
replacing the placeholder bullets in the template. Manual
additions (rules not in INDEX.md) belong **after** the
auto-populated block, under a `**Manual additions**:` sub-heading
preserved from the template.

The renderer is idempotent — running it again with the same
affected files produces byte-identical output, so re-rendering on
each generation pass is safe.

#### 5.4 BDD Scenario Language

When acceptance criteria include BDD-style scenarios, write the
Gherkin keywords, scenario prose, and actor names in the project or
ticket language instead of defaulting to English.
Use Cucumber's official localisation reference for supported
languages and keyword translations:
https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/languages/
When producing a feature-file-style block, include the matching
`# language: <code>` header from the Cucumber language table.

Examples:
- English: `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But`
- Polish (`# language: pl`): `Zakładając, że`, `Kiedy`, `Wtedy`,
  `Oraz`, `Ale`

If the target language is unclear, ask before finalizing BDD
scenarios.
Do not invent translated Gherkin keywords; use the Cucumber reference.

### Phase 6: User Review

**Critical:** Present scoping to user before saving.

Ask for feedback on:
- Architecture decisions
- Missing considerations
- Complexity estimate
- Implementation order

### Phase 7: Save and Update

#### 7.1 Save Scoping Document

Generate the scope-document path via the mktmp MCP tool, then
write the rendered template to it:

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__mktmp(namespace="ticket-scope",
    prefix="<TICKET-ID>-scope", ext=".md")
```

Take the returned `path` and `Write` the document there. Do NOT
hardcode `/tmp/Dev10x/ticket-scope/<TICKET-ID>-scope.md` and do
NOT shell out to `/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh` — the MCP tool is the
preferred path (GH-55 F8).

#### 7.2 Post Scope Summary to the Ticket (Optional)

If the user approves, post the architecture/scope summary as a
comment on the ticket. Pick the transport based on the tracker
detected in Phase 1:

| Tracker | Comment transport |
|---------|-------------------|
| GitHub issue (plain) | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_comment(number=N, repo="OWNER/REPO", body="...")` (GH-228 — added in v0.73.0) |
| GitHub PR | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_issue_comment(pr_number=N, repo="OWNER/REPO", body="...")` |
| Linear | `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__save_comment` against the issue ID |
| JIRA | `Dev10x:jira` skill, comment subcommand |

**Do NOT misuse `pr_issue_comment` for plain GitHub issues** —
the dedicated `issue_comment` tool exists for that path (GH-228).
**Do NOT fall back to raw `gh api POST` for comments** — the MCP
wrapper exists for both PRs and plain issues, so no MCP path is
not a valid excuse.

Linear ticket updates also include:
- Story point estimate (via `save_issue`)
- Links to related resources (in the comment body or via
  `save_issue` relations)

**IMPORTANT:** Never modify the ticket description without
explicit user approval. The comment transport above is for
appending; description edits require a separate gate.
