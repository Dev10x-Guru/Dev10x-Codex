# Dev10x Onboarding Tour Guide

Detailed tour content loaded by the onboarding skill.

## Phase 1: Detect User Context

### 1.1 Experience Level

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).
Options:
- New to Claude Code — First time using AI coding tools
- Know Claude Code, new to Dev10x — Familiar with Claude Code
- Returning user — Used Dev10x before, want a refresher

### 1.2 Configuration Detection

Check what's already set up (skip configured items in tour):

| Check | Command | Configured if |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Git aliases | `git config alias.develop-log` | Non-empty |
| SKILLS.md | `test -f ~/.claude/SKILLS.md` | File exists |
| Global config | `ls ~/.config/Dev10x/` | Dir exists |
| Playbook overrides | `ls .claude/Dev10x/playbooks/*.yaml` | Found |
| Registered platforms | `uvx dev10x platform list` | Non-empty |
| Worktree | `test -f .git` | `.git` is file |

### 1.3 Project Detection

```bash
test -f pyproject.toml     # Python project
test -f package.json       # Node/frontend project
test -f Cargo.toml         # Rust project
```

## Phase 2: Guided Tour

### 2.1 Skill Discovery

```
Dev10x organizes 75+ skills into families:

Pipeline — End-to-end ticket-to-merge workflow
  /Dev10x:work-on <ticket-url>  <- Start here for any task

Git — Atomic commits with gitmoji and JTBD titles
  /Dev10x:git-commit

PR — Full PR lifecycle with CI monitoring
  /Dev10x:gh-pr-create -> /Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor

Session — Track work, defer items, resume later
  /Dev10x:session-wrap-up -> /Dev10x:park-discover

To see all skills: check ~/.claude/SKILLS.md
To regenerate: /Dev10x:skill-index
```

### 2.2 Git Workflow Setup

**Skip if:** Git aliases already configured.

```
Dev10x uses git aliases to avoid permission friction:
  git develop-log   — commits since diverging from develop
  git develop-diff  — diff since diverging from develop
  git develop-rebase — interactive autosquash grooming (not for
                       catching up with a moved base — for that use
                       git fetch origin, then git rebase origin/develop)
```

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).
Options:
- Set up aliases now (Recommended) — Run git-alias-setup
- Skip — I'll set them up later

If user chooses setup: `Skill(skill="Dev10x:git-alias-setup")`

### 2.2b Permission Setup

**Skip if:** Base Dev10x permissions are already present in
`~/.claude/settings.json` (look for entries like
`Bash(/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh:*)` and any
`Bash(~/.claude/plugins/cache/**/skills/git-commit/scripts/...)`
patterns).

```
Dev10x ships with a curated set of allow rules so common skills
run without per-invocation approval prompts. The bootstrap pass
ensures those rules are present in your user settings.
```

**Show the mutating surface before asking for consent (GH-769).**
The bootstrap approves several hundred rules in one action, so a
cautious user cannot tell what state-changing power they just
granted. Before the approval gate below, surface the **mutating**
subset explicitly — read-only and inert rules do not need a gate,
only the surface that can change state. Display this disclosure:

```
Approving the bootstrap pre-approves these STATE-CHANGING actions
(read-only rules are omitted — they can't alter your repo or account):

  Git mutations (git-core)
    git push · git reset --hard · git rebase · git commit ·
    git merge · git cherry-pick · git restore · git stash · git tag
  GitHub mutations (github-cli)
    gh pr create/edit/review/merge · gh issue create/close/edit/comment ·
    gh label create/edit · gh run rerun
  Arbitrary script execution (dev10x-scaffolding)
    /tmp/Dev10x/*.{py,sh} · ~/.claude/tools/* · plugin bin/ + hooks/
    plus Write access under /tmp/Dev10x/
  Settings mutations (dev10x-cli)
    uvx dev10x permission clean / ensure-* (edits your settings.json)

Full read-only + mutating catalog:
  src/dev10x/skills/permission/baseline-permissions.yaml
  skills/upgrade-cleanup/projects.yaml  (tracker MCP rules)
```

<!-- Maintenance (GH-769 follow-up): this list is curated to match the
catalog's mutating surface. The durable fix is to generate it from the
catalog by reading groups tagged `sensitivity: mutating` / `*-write`
(and git/gh/script groups) rather than hand-maintaining it here — that
programmatic generation depends on the PolicySensitivity model gaining a
`mutating` member (today `sensitivity: mutating` in the YAML falls back
to `unspecified`). Tracked under the PAP refactor (#796). Until then,
keep this list in sync when the catalog's mutating groups change. -->

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).
Options:
- Set up permissions now (Recommended) — approve the mutating surface
  above and run the fast bootstrap
- Skip — I'll run `/Dev10x:upgrade-cleanup` later

**Tracker choice — ask BEFORE the bootstrap runs (GH-768).**
`ensure-base` seeds only the chosen tracker's MCP rules, so this
answer has to exist before the bootstrap pass, not after. Skip the
gate entirely when
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__tracker_status` returns `pinned: true` —
the choice is a settled workspace fact, and re-asking it on every
bootstrap is the friction this gate exists to remove.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text) when
`pinned` is `false`. Question: "Which issue tracker does this
project use?" Options:

- **Linear (Recommended)** — seeds the `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__*`
  and `mcp__linear-server__*` read/write tools, plus the
  `delete_*` denies. The default when nothing is chosen.
- **Jira** — seeds the `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian_Rovo__*` read and
  write tools the ticket skills call.
- **GitHub Issues** — seeds the `issue_*` MCP wrappers on top of
  the unconditional `github-cli` group.

Persist the answer with
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pin_tracker(tracker="<choice>")`. It keys
off the repo stem, so one answer covers the repo and every worktree
of it. GitLab and ClickUp are not offered — ClickUp has no native
skill or MCP path, and the `glab` surface is not curated yet; a user
on either should pick the tracker whose rules they actually want and
file an issue for theirs.

If user chooses setup:
`Skill(skill="Dev10x:plugin-maintenance", args="bootstrap")`

The bootstrap pass runs only the steps a new user needs:
migrate any leftover legacy config files, register the
`/tmp/Dev10x` workspace directory (GH-40 — without this every
Write/Edit to `/tmp/Dev10x/...` prompts despite allow-rules),
ensure base permissions, and confirm script coverage. It skips
the heavier post-upgrade steps (path version bumps,
generalization, full permission audit, project-settings dedup)
— those remain available via `/Dev10x:upgrade-cleanup` whenever
the user wants the comprehensive sweep.

### 2.2b-2 Review Policy (ADR-0022)

**Skip if:** `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__supervisor_review_status()`
returns `pinned: true` — the choice is a settled workspace fact, and
re-asking it on every onboarding run is exactly the friction this gate
exists to remove.

```
Dev10x asks one durable question about how this project ships:

  Does the supervisor read the PR before it moves on?

AI self-review and CI always run first, in every posture (ADR-0022
D-4) — this only decides whether the agent also waits for you.
```

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text) when
`pinned` is `false`. Question: "Does the supervisor read the PR
before it moves on?" Options:

- **Yes — the supervisor reviews first (Recommended)** —
  `supervisor_review=required`. In a solo repo the park lands before
  merge; in a team repo it lands before teammates are asked to review
  (ADR-0022 D-3). This is the safe default.
- **No — the agent ships it** — `supervisor_review=none`.

Persist the answer with
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pin_supervisor_review(value="required"|"none")`.
It keys off the repo stem, so one answer covers the repo and every
worktree of it — same repo-scoping as `pin_tracker` above. There is no
`strict` / `guided` / `adaptive` preset to pick (ADR-0022 D-1);
`adaptive` is the sole shipped baseline and every gate auto-advances
unless this posture, a floor, or a project pin says otherwise.

### 2.2c Platform Registration

**Skip if:** `uvx dev10x platform list` already reports one or
more registered platforms.

```
Dev10x can target more than one AI assistant — Claude Code,
GitHub Copilot CLI, Windsurf, Continue, and Cursor. Registering
a platform records where it keeps its config, plugins, and
settings so skills target the right paths without per-user path
editing (and without symlinks, so Windows stays safe).

See the built-in catalog:
  uvx dev10x platform known

Register the one you work in:
  uvx dev10x platform add claude-code

Pass --playbook <file> to prefer a specific work-on playbook for
that platform, or --config-dir to override its default location.
```

Run `uvx dev10x platform known` to show the supported catalog
before asking.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).
Options:
- Register this platform now (Recommended) — runs
  `uvx dev10x platform add <name>` for the assistant in use
- Add a different platform — register Copilot CLI, Windsurf,
  Continue, or Cursor instead
- Skip — I'll run `uvx dev10x platform add` later

If the user chooses to register, run the matching command, e.g.:
`uvx dev10x platform add claude-code`

Then confirm with `uvx dev10x platform list` so the new
registration is visible. This is the operational entry point for
the multi-platform surface — onboarding is where a user declares
which assistants Dev10x should target.

### 2.3 PR Pipeline Demo

```
The Dev10x PR pipeline automates the full shipping flow:

1. /Dev10x:git-commit    — Gitmoji + JTBD commit message
2. /Dev10x:gh-pr-create  — Draft PR with Job Story
3. /Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor — Background CI + review monitoring
4. /Dev10x:git-groom     — Clean commit history
5. /Dev10x:gh-pr-respond — Address review comments

Or use /Dev10x:work-on <ticket> for the full pipeline.
```

### 2.4 Session Management

```
Dev10x tracks your work across sessions:

- /Dev10x:session-wrap-up — Save open work before closing
- /Dev10x:park            — Defer a task to the right place
- /Dev10x:park-discover   — Find deferred items at start
```

### 2.5 Customization

**Skip if:** Playbook overrides already exist.

```
Customize Dev10x behavior per project:

- Playbooks: Override workflow steps
  /Dev10x:playbook edit work-on feature

- Memory: Teach Dev10x about your project

- CLAUDE.md: Project-level instructions
```

### 2.6 Tour Summary

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).
Options:
- Start working — I have a task to begin (Recommended)
- Explore more — Show me additional capabilities
- Set up customization — Help me configure playbooks

## Phase 3: Setup Assistance (Optional)
