# Dev10x:git — Hardened Git Operations

Provides hardened scripts for safe git push and non-interactive rebase.
Add the `allowed-tools` entries to your project's `settings.local.json`
to pre-approve the scripts without per-call prompts.

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.
Create a task at invocation, mark completed when done:

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Safe git push", activeForm="Pushing safely")`

Mark completed when done: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`

## Safe Push

**Primary: MCP tool call** (no permission friction):

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__push_safe(args=["origin", "branch"])
```

MCP calls avoid `Bash()` allow-rule matching and provide
structured responses. Use the MCP tool as the default for
all push operations.

### Configuring `protected_branches`

`push_safe` blocks **`--force`** to a protected branch, and an ordinary
push is always allowed. A `--force-with-lease` is allowed on any branch
too, with one condition on a protected one: the remote tip must already
be an ancestor of what you are pushing (GH-1270). Protection resolves in
three tiers (GH-1031):

1. The `protected_branches` call parameter, when non-empty.
2. Else the project's durable `protected_branches` key in the
   matching `projects[]` entry of `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml`.
3. Else `git-push-safe.sh`'s own default set:
   `main master develop development staging trunk`.

Each tier REPLACES the one below it rather than adding to it, so a
list that names `release/*` must re-list the integration branches it
still wants covered. Glob patterns are supported at every tier.

Prefer tier 2 for anything durable: an unattended agent never passes
a per-call list, which is exactly when an unprotected force-push
costs the most.

```yaml
# ~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml
projects:
  - match: ["*/my-repo", "*/my-repo-*"]
    protected_branches: [main, release/*, staging]
```

| Recipe | Call | When |
|---|---|---|
| Default (any workflow) | `push_safe(args=["origin","feature"])` | Feature branches; the six-branch default set applies |
| Protect only `main` for this call | `push_safe(args=["origin","develop"], protected_branches=["main"])` | Solo flow that force-pushes `develop` as integration |
| Add a release branch | `push_safe(args=["origin","feature"], protected_branches=["main","develop","release/*"])` | Long-lived release branches that must never be force-pushed |
| Protect a non-standard branch everywhere | durable `protected_branches` (above) | The project's integration branch is not in the default set |

**`protected_branches=[]` does NOT disable protection.** An empty
list reads as "no override" and falls through to the tiers below, so
the default set still applies. To force-push a branch in the default
set, pass a list that omits it (`protected_branches=["main"]` to
force-push `develop`). Turning protection off entirely is
deliberately not expressible — the shell layer has no such flag.

**Solo-maintainer rule of thumb:** when a hook denial says
`Skill: Dev10x:git`, the fix is almost always to re-invoke
`push_safe` with the right `protected_branches` list. Reach for
the skill's documented escape paths — not env-level bypasses —
when the wrapper itself blocks: hook overrides live in the hook
layer (see `.claude/rules/hook-patterns.md`), not at the caller.

If the call still blocks after adjusting `protected_branches`,
read the returned `blocked_reason` field — it names the exact
flag (`--force` on a protected branch, divergent ref, etc.) so
you can adjust the call rather than escalating.

**MCP server unavailable.** If `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__push_safe`
is listed as "no longer available" in system-reminders, STOP and
ask the user to reconnect via `/mcp` or a session restart. Do NOT
fall back to the wrapper script (blocked by
`validate-bash-command.py`) or env-level bypasses — see
`references/mcp-unavailable-escape-hatch.md` for the documented
recovery path.

### Post-push CI monitoring (GH-117 #2)

**On successful push to a branch with an open PR, the next
action is `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` — not "wait and see".**
A push to a PR branch retriggers CI; failing to monitor it
turns a deviation into an oversight.

### `push_safe` return shape

On success, `push_safe` returns a structured payload:

```json
{
  "pushed": true,
  "ref": "<branch>",
  "remote": "origin",
  "sha": "<short-sha>",
  "tracking": "origin/<branch>",
  "ci_run_url": null
}
```

On a blocked or failed push, `pushed` is `false` and `blocked_reason`
names the cause (`protected_branch_force_push`, `push_failed`, …).
A returned `{"error": "..."}` payload signals an MCP-level failure
distinct from `pushed: false`.

> **Historical note (GH-188):** earlier versions returned `{}` on
> success and required a separate `git ls-remote` round-trip to
> confirm the remote accepted the ref. New callers should branch on
> the `pushed` field; existing callers tolerating `{}` continue to
> work because the new payload is strictly additive.

After `push_safe` returns:

1. Resolve PR state for the pushed branch via
   `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_detect`.
2. If a PR exists and is OPEN, immediately invoke
   `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` so the supervisor's CI-poll
   micro-agent dispatches before the user has to ask.
3. If no PR exists (push is the first push of a new branch),
   skip this auto-chain — the next step is `Dev10x:gh-pr-create`
   in the work-on plan.

When this skill is invoked from inside `Dev10x:work-on`,
work-on's pr-continuation play moves `Monitor CI` to
`in_progress` automatically (see work-on instructions §
Post-push auto-advance). When invoked standalone, the user is
responsible for the chain, but this skill's success message
should still surface a "Next: `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)`"
hint so the next move is unambiguous.

**There is no wrapper-script fallback (GH-1025).** Earlier versions of
this skill documented
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/scripts/git-push-safe.sh` as a
fallback, but the `git-push-safe-script` rule in
`command-skill-map.yaml` hard-blocks that path with "use the MCP tool
instead" — so following the instruction produced a guaranteed block.
A skill must never instruct an action its own guardrail forbids. The
script still ships (other tooling shells out to it); it is not an
agent-facing entry point.

`push_safe` blocks bare `--force` / `-f` on protected branches. The
resolved protected set is the one documented above — the shell script's
own default is the last tier, not a separate list.

`--force-with-lease` is allowed everywhere else, but a **protected**
target is fetched first and refused with `blocked_reason:
"base_behind_remote"` unless its remote tip is already an ancestor of
the pushed ref (GH-1270). A lease is not the protection it reads as
here: it compares the remote against the local remote-tracking ref, so
a `develop` last fetched hours ago leases cleanly against its own stale
copy and overwrites every merge landed since — seven PRs were erased
that way in eleven minutes, with git reporting success and `git diff`
showing nothing, because the two tips shared a tree. The refusal names
the commits that would be dropped; rebase onto `origin/<base>` and push
again. When the fetch itself fails the push is refused as
`base_fetch_failed` rather than attempted blind — unless the branch
does not exist on the remote yet, which has nothing to lose.

## Non-Interactive Rebase

Two scripts power fully automated rebases:

- **`git-seq-editor.sh`** — replaces `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`; reads the
  rebase todo from the path in `GROOM_SEQ_FILE` env var.
- **`git-rebase-groom.sh`** — convenience wrapper that sets
  `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` and `GIT_EDITOR=true`, then runs
  `git rebase -i <base-ref>`. Takes `<seq-file> <base-ref>` args.

### Usage

1. Create a unique temp file for the rebase sequence:

```bash
/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh git rebase-seq .txt
```

Store the returned path (e.g., `/tmp/Dev10x/git/rebase-seq.a7b3c9.txt`).

2. Write the rebase todo (oldest commit first) to that file using
   the Write tool:

```
Write <unique-path>:
pick abc1234 First commit
pick def5678 Second commit
fixup fed9876 fixup! Second commit
```

**Note:** The Write tool requires reading a file before writing to it.
For a new file, `mktmp.sh` already created it (empty), so Read it first,
then Write the sequence content.

3. Run the rebase with the sequence file as the first argument:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/scripts/git-rebase-groom.sh <unique-path> <base-ref>
```

### Sequence file ordering

The sequence file must list commits **oldest at the top, newest at the
bottom** — the same order `git rebase -i` expects. Use `tac` to
reverse `git log` output:

```bash
git log --oneline <base>..HEAD | tac
```

### SHA staleness

After each rebase pass all commit SHAs change. Always re-run
`git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` after each pass and use fresh SHAs
when writing the next sequence file.

## Branch Comparison Aliases

Use git aliases instead of embedding `$(git merge-base ...)` in
commands. The `$(...)` substitution creates compound commands that
break Claude Code permission prefix matching, causing unnecessary
permission prompts.

| Alias                | Equivalent                                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git develop-log`    | `git log --oneline $(git merge-base develop HEAD)..HEAD`       |
| `git develop-diff`   | `git diff $(git merge-base develop HEAD)..HEAD`                |
| `git develop-rebase` | `git rebase -i --autosquash $(git merge-base develop HEAD)`    |

The alias name includes the base branch. When a different base is
needed (e.g., `trunk`), add a parallel set: `trunk-log`, `trunk-diff`,
`trunk-rebase`.

**Never use `$(git merge-base ...)` inline** — always use the alias.

`{base}-rebase` grooms `fixup!` commits back to the merge-base. It is
interactive and resolves the merge-base against the **local** `{base}`
ref, so it is unusable by an unattended agent — it hangs without an
editor, and a stale local ref makes it report success without moving
HEAD (GH-964). Groom non-interactively with `rebase_groom`. To catch
up with a base that moved, no alias applies: run `git fetch origin`,
then `git rebase origin/<base>`, then assert
`git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<base> HEAD` exits 0.

## settings.local.json wiring

Add to your project's `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/scripts/git-rebase-groom.sh:*)",
      "Bash(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/scripts/git-seq-editor.sh:*)",
      "Bash(git reset --soft:*)",
      "Bash(git push --force-with-lease:*)",
      "Bash(/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh:*)",
      "Edit(/tmp/Dev10x/git/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```
