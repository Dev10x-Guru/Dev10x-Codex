# Resolve force-ness, the remote, and every target branch in ONE pass over
# PUSH_ARGS, so flags and positionals are classified against the same view
# of the argument list (GH-1049).
#
# Force spellings recognised:
#   --force / -f            long options match exactly, so the deliberately
#                           allowed --force-with-lease never matches on a
#                           substring
#   -uf / -fu / -vuf        single-dash tokens are decomposed letter-by-letter
#                           because POSIX bundling spells a force push without
#                           a lone -f (GH-1047)
#   origin +evil:main       a leading + on a refspec IS the force marker, and
#                           carries no force flag at all (GH-1049 gap 3)
#
# Positionals are counted rather than inferred from `remote`'s value: the old
# loop treated the second positional as the refspec only while `remote` still
# held its initial "origin", so pushing to a remote actually NAMED origin
# re-entered the first branch and overwrote `remote` with the branch. The
# target then fell back to HEAD, and a force push to `main` was never seen as
# targeting main at all (GH-1049 gap 1).
#
# A value-taking flag's value is skipped, otherwise it lands in the positional
# stream and shifts every index after it (GH-1049 gap 2). Optional-value flags
# (--force-with-lease) are absent by design — they are commonly spelled bare
# and consuming the next token would swallow the remote.
#
# `--force-with-lease` is tracked separately as `lease`, not folded into
# `force`: it stays ALLOWED on every branch, and only feeds the
# base-ancestry gate below (GH-1270).
