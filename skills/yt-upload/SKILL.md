# Dev10x:yt-upload — publish a recording as unlisted

Everything runs through `scripts/upload-video.py`. Never call `gog` or the
YouTube API directly — the wrapper owns token borrowing, scope verification,
artifact selection, channel assertion, and the shred-on-exit guarantee.

## Never publish a production recording

**Unlisted is not private.** Anyone holding the link can watch, forever, with
no org boundary and no audit trail. Staging fixtures are fine; production
recordings are not.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text) before the first
upload in a session. The operator must *state* the judgement — a recording's
provenance is not something a script can determine, and letting it pass
silently is how real customer data reaches a world-readable URL. Options:

- **Staging / synthetic fixture — publish (Recommended)** — the footage shows
  seeded or `[TEST]` data only.
- **Contains real customer data — do not publish** — stop here; hand over the
  local file path instead.
- **Unsure** — treat as production and stop. Verify before publishing, not
  after.

A general "go ahead" earlier in the session does **not** satisfy this gate.
Neither does an approval from a caller's own review gate: approving *that the
footage is good* is a different decision from approving *that it may become
world-readable*.

## Review the footage locally first

An upload cannot be quietly withdrawn. When invoked from
`Dev10x:qa-self`, its Phase 4.4 gate has already shown the frames — but this
skill re-reads the narration manifest itself rather than assuming a caller
gated, because it can also be invoked directly.

**On a direct invocation, actually watch the footage** (`mpv --no-terminal
<file>`, or hand the path to the operator) before the gate below. A recording
is the one artifact whose defects are invisible to every automated check: the
capture run goes green while the overlay failed to install, a caption plays
over the wrong element, or the footage documents behaviour that changed last
week. A minute of human watching catches all three. A missing player is not a
reason to publish unreviewed — hand over the path instead.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/yt-upload/scripts/upload-video.py \
  resolve-video --run-dir <RUN_DIR>
```

`resolve-video` picks the **one** artifact to publish and reports why. It
prefers `*-narrated.mp4` when present: `convert-evidence.sh narrate` writes
the narrated take as a *sibling* and deletes nothing, so a run directory can
hold both, and detection is presence-only — there is no manifest field saying
a run was narrated. Publishing both would put two near-identical videos on an
append-only evidence trail.

It also returns `narration_defects`. When that list is non-empty — captions
that played with no audio, or an `install` anchor that offsets every cue —
**do not publish without surfacing it.** A partly-silent or systematically
offset walkthrough is worse on YouTube than on a ticket: the ticket has
watchers, the URL has whoever holds it. Report the defects and re-capture, or
publish only on an explicit operator decision that names them.

**An empty `narration_defects` is not a quality verdict.** It means nothing
*mechanically* detectable went wrong — the overlay installed, the audio
rendered, the timing lines up. It says nothing about whether the captions are
*true*. A caption that renders perfectly and asserts something false about
the UI passes every check here.

That is not hypothetical: on one recorded run (TD-5642) the closing card
claimed an empty state reads as a sentence, which was true on one surface and
false on another — the video reached YouTube and a merged PR's evidence trail
before a human watching caught it and it was re-recorded. Never treat a clean
`resolve-video` as clearing the footage; that is what the human watching is
for.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check` | Is gog reachable, is `youtube.upload` granted, who will publish |
| `pin` | Persist account/channel defaults to `~/.config/Dev10x/yt-upload.yaml` |
| `resolve-video` | Pick the one artifact to publish from a qa-self run dir |
| `upload` | Upload and return the per-destination embed forms |
| `update` | Correct the title or description of a published video |
| `delete` | Permanently remove a published video |

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/yt-upload/scripts/upload-video.py check

${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/yt-upload/scripts/upload-video.py \
  upload --video <RUN_DIR>/video/qa-GH-42-narrated.mp4 \
         --title "GH-42 — assigning a work order from the queue" \
         --description-file <RUN_DIR>/description.txt
```

## Correcting and removing what was published

A published video is not immutable, and neither is its description
(GH-1206). Use `update` when a caveat surfaces after upload — the GitHub
comment can be edited, and until now the YouTube description could not,
so anyone opening the raw link saw the uncorrected version:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/yt-upload/scripts/upload-video.py \
  update --video-id <ID> --description-file <RUN_DIR>/description.txt
```

`videos.update` REPLACES the snippet rather than merging into it, so the
script reads the stored snippet first and merges your fields onto it. When
that read-back fails it **refuses** rather than writing a partial snippet
that would clear the fields it could not see.

Use `delete` for a superseded take, so a stale unlisted link stops
resolving for anyone still holding it:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/yt-upload/scripts/upload-video.py \
  delete --video-id <ID> --yes
```

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** before any `delete`. Deletion is
permanent, nothing in Dev10x can undo it, and a wrong id destroys someone
else's evidence. The `--yes` flag is a second interlock, not a substitute
for the gate — the script refuses without it.

**Scope.** `update` and `delete` need `youtube.force-ssl`; `upload` needs
only `youtube.upload`. The narrow upload-only grant is a genuine safety
property, so the wider scope is demanded per-operation and `check` still
reports on the upload scope. Re-authorize when you first need it:

```bash
gog auth add <email> --services youtube \
  --extra-scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl \
  --force-consent --remote --step 1
```

Every command prints JSON to stdout. On failure it prints `{"error": "..."}`
to **stdout** and exits non-zero, so a caller parses one channel and never
sees empty output on failure.

**Always resolve a channel.** Without one, an upload lands on whichever
channel the grant happens to default to, silently. `upload` asserts the
stored channel matches and fails loudly if it does not — but only when a
channel is configured, so pin one.

## Use the returned markdown verbatim

`upload` returns `linear_markdown` and `github_markdown`. They are **not**
interchangeable, and hand-reconstructing either is how a link ends up
unclickable or an image ends up broken. See
[`references/destinations.md`](references/destinations.md) for why each
destination needs its own form, the poster-frame 404 window, and the
image-host trap that catches screenshots too.

Once a Linear comment is handed to a human to finish embedding, **stop
writing to that comment** — a later API write silently overwrites their edit.

## Prerequisites

This skill borrows a live token from [`gog`](https://gogcli.sh) rather than
holding a credential of its own, so there is no client secret to distribute
and nothing secret in the repo or the config file.

Run `check` after each setup step rather than working the list top to bottom
blind — it names the next thing to fix.

**Full setup:
[`Dev10x:gog` § YouTube](../gog/references/youtube.md)**, with the shared
OAuth traps in
[`references/auth-setup.md`](../gog/references/auth-setup.md). The four
that decide whether a first-time setup succeeds:

1. **The OAuth client must be a *Desktop app*.** gog binds a random
   loopback port and only desktop clients get the any-port exemption; a web
   client fails with `redirect_uri_mismatch` naming a port that differs
   next run.
2. **Authorize YouTube as its own grant** — `--services youtube`. Google
   refuses Drive and YouTube scopes in one consent, so appending
   `--extra-scopes …/youtube.upload` to a list containing `drive` cannot
   succeed. A separate grant leaves Drive and Gmail untouched.
3. **Use `--remote --step 1` / `--step 2 --auth-url`.** Claude Code
   backgrounds anything past 120s, so the loopback browser flow dies with
   `context deadline exceeded` every time.
4. **If consent is still refused with "scopes that cannot be requested
   together", set `include_granted_scopes=false` in the printed URL.** gog
   hardcodes it on, so a consent screen already carrying Drive scopes gets
   them folded back in and rejected.

The YouTube Data API v3 must also be enabled on that client's Cloud
project; `check` names the console URL when it is not.

### Why the script transfers the bytes itself

gog owns auth but **cannot carry a media body** — there is no
`youtube videos insert`, and `api call` takes JSON only — so the resumable
`videos.insert` is hand-rolled here with gog's exported token. Everything
gog *can* do stays with gog: warming the token, minting the credential, and
confirming the upload landed. See
[`Dev10x:gog` § There is no upload command](../gog/references/youtube.md).

**Re-check on a gog upgrade.** If a media flag appears, move the transfer to
gog and delete the hand-rolled `open_session`/`upload` pair — it exists only
because gog cannot do it.

## Account and channel preference

Resolved highest-first: flag → `DEV10X_YT_ACCOUNT` / `DEV10X_YT_CHANNEL` →
a matching `projects[]` entry in `~/.config/Dev10x/yt-upload.yaml` → its
`defaults` → nothing. There is deliberately **no built-in account default** —
a wrong-account default publishes to a stranger's channel, which is exactly
what a default must not invent.

```yaml
# ~/.config/Dev10x/yt-upload.yaml
defaults:
  account: you@example.com
  channel: UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
projects:
  - match: ["*/my-repo", "*/my-repo-*"]
    channel: UCyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/yt-upload/scripts/upload-video.py \
  pin --account you@example.com --channel UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The file lives under `~/.config/Dev10x/` alongside the other durable prefs
(ADR-0018), so one answer covers a repo and every worktree of it and no
self-settings consent gate fires.

## How the token is handled

`gog auth tokens export` writes a **live access token** to a file. The
script creates its directory with `mkdtemp` (atomic, mode `0700`, owned by
the caller) rather than building a path in world-writable `/tmp` where
`mkdir(exist_ok=True)` would silently reuse a directory another local user
owns — directory ownership is the control here, not path secrecy. It
tightens the umask before invoking gog so the file is owner-only from
creation rather than from the `chmod` that follows.

The token is used as a Bearer header, never logged, never passed in a gog
argv, never returned in the JSON. The client secret is never read and the
refresh token is never exchanged.

Cleanup shreds the file and removes its directory in a `finally`, and a
`SIGTERM` handler routes an external `kill` through the same path — Python's
default disposition would otherwise exit without unwinding and leave the
export behind. `SIGKILL` and a host crash cannot be covered by any design;
if shredding fails the script says so on stderr, because a surviving export
is a live credential.

Shredding is best-effort, not a secure erase — on CoW filesystems, SSDs with
wear levelling, or an encrypted volume the original blocks may survive. That
is an accepted trade-off for a token that lives for seconds and that gog can
revoke and reissue. This is the worked reference for the token-handling rule
in [`Dev10x:gog` § Tokens](../gog/references/auth-setup.md).
