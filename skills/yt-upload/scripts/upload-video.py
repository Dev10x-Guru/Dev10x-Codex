"""Publish a recording to YouTube as unlisted and return per-destination embeds.

Auth model: ``gog`` already holds a live OAuth access token. We warm it,
export it, use it, and shred the export. The OAuth client secret is never
needed and never read, and the long-lived refresh token is never used for an
exchange — so this script holds no credential of its own and nothing
secret ever reaches the repo or the config file.

Secrets live in memory only. They are never printed and never logged.

Every subcommand prints JSON to stdout. On failure it prints
``{"error": "..."}`` to **stdout** and exits non-zero, so a caller parses one
channel and never sees empty stdout on failure.

Subcommands:
    check           Is gog reachable, is youtube.upload granted, who will publish
    pin             Persist account/channel defaults to ~/.config/Dev10x/yt-upload.yaml
    resolve-video   Pick the one artifact to publish from a qa-self run directory
    upload          Upload the video and return the embed forms
    update          Correct the title or description of a published video
    delete          Permanently remove a published video

``update`` and ``delete`` need the broader ``youtube.force-ssl`` scope;
``upload`` keeps the narrow ``youtube.upload``. The split is deliberate —
a grant that can only add is a meaningful safety property, so the wider
scope is demanded per-operation rather than requested up front (GH-1206).

    the edit view.

    GitHub strips <iframe>, so no player can render in a comment. A linked
    poster frame is the closest equivalent, and unlike a plain link it
    cannot be scrolled past.

    The Linear paste-time behaviour above is inherited from the userspace
    skill this ports, whose author observed it directly.

    [Verify] The hosts are said not to cross over — img.youtube.com renders
    on GitHub (camo-proxied) but not in Linear; uploads.linear.app renders
    in Linear but 401s for anyone on GitHub. That claim comes from the
    ported skill's OWN documentation and has been verified by nobody: the
    session that ran the tool end to end declined to corroborate it, having
    only ever used img.youtube.com on GitHub and a bare URL in Linear. It
    is the reason these two fields exist, so it deserves a deliberate
