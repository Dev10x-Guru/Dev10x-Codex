# Dev10x:work-on — Adaptive Work Orchestrator (Instructions)

## Overview

This skill turns any combination of inputs into a structured,
supervisor-approved work plan. It runs in four phases:

1. **Parse & Classify** — identify what each input is
2. **Gather** — fetch context from all sources in parallel
3. **Plan** — build a task list for supervisor approval
4. **Execute** — work through tasks, expanding epics on demand

The supervisor sees progress via `TaskList`, can approve/edit
the plan, and can pause at any point with `Dev10x:session-wrap-up`.

**Rule: ALWAYS use `TaskCreate`** — even for single-task work.
The visible task list is the supervisor's interface for adding
new tasks mid-session. Skipping it removes that capability.

**Invariant: never leave the session with an empty task list
(GH-149).** Until the supervisor explicitly closes the session
(`Dev10x:session-wrap-up` or session restart), the task list MUST
contain at least one open task. The terminal task is always
`Verify acceptance criteria` — it is the last task in every play
and it MUST NOT be marked `completed` or `deleted` until the
supervisor confirms the work is shippable (PR linked, CI green,
no unresolved review comments, AC satisfied). When new
instructions arrive mid-session, the new TODOs land **before**
the Verify-AC task — they do not replace it. An empty task list
at the moment of a new prompt creates competition for attention
and is a Phase 4 violation.

**REQUIRED: Create phase tasks before ANY work.** At session
start, create exactly 4 top-level tasks — one per phase:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 1: Parse & Classify inputs", activeForm="Classifying inputs")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 2: Gather context", activeForm="Gathering context")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 3: Build work plan", activeForm="Building plan")`
4. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 4: Execute plan", activeForm="Executing")`

Set sequential dependencies (each phase blocked by the previous).
During each phase, create subtasks for the concrete work items
discovered — e.g., Phase 2 creates one subtask per source being
fetched, Phase 4 creates subtasks per plan step.

## Phase 0: Session Posture (GH-689, ADR-0022)

**At the very start** — before Phase 1 — make sure this project has a
review posture, so the gates downstream have a policy to resolve
against.

**Skip this entirely when:** running as a nested invocation from
`Dev10x:fanout` (fanout settles posture once for the entire
session).

**Otherwise, resolve the session-adoption gate first.** Call
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="session_adoption",
context={})`. The tool determines on its own whether the persisted
session is stale (`session_stale`) — computed from the plan-sync
`branch`/`tickets` identity (ADR-0018), not a `.claude/Dev10x`
file — so do not read or hand-compare any config yourself.

- `effect == "auto-advance"` — a valid, non-stale session exists;
  adopt it silently and skip the write below (the resolved prefs are
  authoritative). Surface the returned `record` line in the
  transcript so a present supervisor can veto.
- `effect == "ask"` — no valid session config exists (or it is
  stale). Fall through to the posture check below.
- `effect == "skip"` — skip the check entirely, no config change.
- Response has an `error` key — fail safe: fall through to the
  posture check below.

### Settle the review posture (ADR-0022)

There is no friction-level question here any more. `adaptive` is the
sole shipped baseline (ADR-0022 D-1) — there is no `strict` /
`guided` / `adaptive` picker to offer, and this skill must not
reintroduce one. The one durable question ("does the supervisor read
the PR before the next step is allowed?") belongs to
`Dev10x:friction-setup`, which owns both the ask and the write.

1. Call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__supervisor_review_status()`.
2. `pinned: true` — a `projects[]` entry already answers this for the
   repo. Adopt the resolved `supervisor_review` silently, persist
   nothing, and continue to Phase 1.
3. `pinned: false` — this project is unconfigured. Delegate:
   `Skill(Dev10x:friction-setup)`. It fires the blocking review-policy
   gate, collects any overlays / per-gate deviations, and persists
   them through the locked writers. Continue to Phase 1 when it
   returns, whatever the supervisor answered — a dismissal simply
   leaves the safe unset default (`supervisor_review: required`) in
   place.

**Never write `friction.yaml` from this skill.** No Write/Edit of
`friction_level`, `active_modes`, or a hand-built `projects[]` entry:
the pin tools lock and atomically write (GH-827 / ADR-0011), and
nothing durable is written under a repo's `.claude/` at all
(ADR-0018), so Claude Code's self-settings consent gate never fires
(GH-812). When no `friction.yaml` exists yet, `Dev10x:friction-setup`
seeds it; `Skill(Dev10x:session-config-seed)` (or `dev10x session
seed`) is the standalone idempotent equivalent.

**Session identity is NOT written here (ADR-0018).** The
`session_adoption` gate keys on `session_stale`, which the resolver
computes from the plan-sync `branch`/`tickets` (persisted at Persist
Plan Context via `plan_sync_set_context` — both MCP-written and
gate-free). The retired `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml` no longer
stores identity: do **not** Write/Edit it, and no per-project
`.gitignore` edit for session state is needed — nothing durable is
written under the repo's `.claude/` anymore.

**How this skill consumes the posture:** it does not. Every gate
below calls `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate=…, context=…)`
and branches on the returned `effect` (`ask` / `auto-advance` /
`skip`). The resolver reads the preset, the overlays, the project
pin, and `supervisor_review` itself, and applies the floors that
protect an irreversible step. Never re-derive a gate's behaviour from
a config value in prose — a skill that reads policy keys can only
disagree with the resolver. `references/friction-levels.md` documents
the resulting behaviour matrix.

## Phase 0.5: Resumed-Plan Task-List Reconstruction (GH-861)

On a process restart mid-work-on, the SessionStart hook rehydrates
the plan-sync **context** banner but CANNOT repopulate the visible
**TaskList** — a hook only mirrors Claude's `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`
calls into `plan.yaml` (PostToolUse), it cannot issue them. So after
a resume the task tree is empty even though the persisted plan still
holds every task. Left unhandled, the empty-task-list invariant
(GH-149) is silently violated across the resume boundary and the
terminal Verify-AC / Monitor gate is lost.

**REQUIRED before creating the fresh 4 phase tasks:** detect and
reconstruct a resumed plan. Execute these steps at startup:

1. Call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__plan_sync_json_summary()`.
2. If the response has `plan.status == "in_progress"` AND
   `plan.tasks` is non-empty AND the current `TaskList` is empty
   (the resume signature), do NOT create the fresh 4 phase tasks.
   Instead, for each persisted task re-issue `TaskCreate` (subject
   from `task.subject`, description/metadata carried over) and then
   `TaskUpdate` to restore its `status`, oldest first so ordering is
   preserved. This rebuilds the supervisor's visible tree from the
   persisted plan rather than from conversation memory.
3. Confirm the reconstructed list ends with the terminal Verify-AC
   (or "Monitor PR") task; if the persisted plan lacks one, append it
   so the invariant holds.
4. If any condition in step 2 is false (fresh session, no persisted
   plan, or TaskList already populated), skip reconstruction and
   proceed to Phase 1's normal 4-phase-task creation.

The banner's `Plan branch` now reflects the persisted branch (the
`branch` reserved key mirrors to the plan's top-level metadata), so
a resumed session shows the real feature branch, not the base.

## Prerequisites

| Capability | Required for | Tool |

  thread, Sentry link, or free text description
- User wants to start structured work with progress tracking
- User wants comprehensive context before starting

---

## Phase 1: Parse & Classify

Accept the user's arguments as a space-separated list. Each
argument is classified independently:

| Pattern | Type | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| `https://github.com/.../issues/N` | `github-issue` | Extract repo + issue number |
| `https://github.com/.../pull/N` | `github-pr` | Extract repo + PR number |
| `https://linear.app/.../issue/XXX-N/...` | `linear-ticket` | Extract ticket ID (e.g., `TEAM-133`) |
| `https://.*slack.com/archives/C.../p...` | `slack-thread` | Store channel + timestamp |
| `https://sentry.io/.../issues/N` | `sentry-issue` | Extract issue ID |
| `https://*.sentry.io/issues/N` | `sentry-issue` | Extract issue ID |
| `https://...atlassian.net/browse/XX-N` | `jira-ticket` | Extract ticket ID |
| `GH-N` | `github-issue` | Route to `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker` |
| `TEAM-N` (Linear prefix) | `linear-ticket` | Route to `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker` |
| `JIRA-N` | `jira-ticket` | Route to `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker` |
| `#N` (bare number) | `github-pr` | Resolve against current repo |
| Anything else | `note` | Store as free-text context |

For ticket IDs, call the tracker detector MCP tool:
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker(ticket_id="$TICKET_ID")`
Parse `tracker`, `ticket_number`, and `fixes_url` from the response.

Each classified input becomes a **source** entry with its type and
extracted identifiers. Collect all sources into a list for Phase 2.

### Embedded Questions Are Side Quests (GH-865)

`Dev10x:work-on` delivers a **real artifact** — a merged PR, a
committed fix, a shipped change — in ~99% of invocations.
Answering a question or "just investigating" is almost never the
terminal goal. When the input mixes an artifact target (a ticket
URL, PR link, or issue/ticket ID) with an inline question (e.g.
`work-on <PR-URL> what does ignore_conflicts=True do?`), the
question is **supplementary context**, not the goal.

**Classification rule:**

- A free-text question or investigation ask that accompanies at
  least one recognized artifact target is folded into that
  target's context — it feeds Phase 2 (Gather) and Phase 3
  (Plan). It does NOT become a standalone `note` that supersedes
  task-list creation. **The work-on workflow always wins:**
  instantiate the full Phase 1–4 task list and answer the
  question inline as part of the work.
- Flag such notes as `context_only = true` in the Phase 1 output
  so Phase 3 never routes them into a `local-only` "answer the
  question" play.

**Edge case — pure question, no artifact target:** Only when
**every** input classifies as `note` and reads as a question (no
ticket, PR, or URL present) is answering plausibly the intent.
Handle it as the exception via the Ambiguous Input Fallback below
(the pure-question confirmation), not the default. When any
artifact target is present, skip the confirmation and default to
the full workflow.

**Anti-pattern (GH-865):** `work-on <PR-URL> what does
ignore_conflicts=True do?` handled as a Q&A turn — the Phase 1–4
task list was never created until the supervisor asked "where is
the work-on task list?". The question displaced the workflow
instead of feeding it.

### Multi-Ticket Detection (GH-196)

After classification, count sources whose type is a ticket or
GitHub issue (`github-issue`, `linear-ticket`, `jira-ticket`).
When the count is **≥ 2**, set `bundling_candidate = true` on the
Phase 1 output. This flag is the trigger that surfaces the Phase 3
Multi-Issue Strategy gate (see § Multi-Issue Execution) instead of
auto-routing into a single-ticket play.

`github-pr` inputs do NOT count toward the bundling-candidate
threshold — a PR is the unit of shipping, so combining a ticket
with its own PR is PR-continuation, not a bundle. Mixed input
where multiple tickets accompany one PR is still PR-continuation
on the PR, with the tickets used as additional context.

The flag is a *candidate* marker — it does not commit the session
to bundling. Phase 3 resolves the actual strategy (separate PRs vs
single bundled PR with batches) using the Same-Milestone Heuristic
and, if needed, the explicit strategy gate.

### Structured-Spec Suitability Gate (GH-174)

After classification, decide whether the ticket is a good fit for
the SPDD-style `structured-spec` play. Run this gate per ticket
source (not per session) — a session bundling several tickets may
route some through `structured-spec` and others through `feature`.

**Poor fit (skip the gate, fall back to default play):**

- Single-file tweaks, config-only changes, dependency bumps
- Exploratory spikes or research tickets
- One-off scripts that won't be reused
- Doc-only changes
- Bug fixes whose root cause is named in the ticket body

**Good fit (offer `structured-spec` at Phase 3):**

- New features touching ≥ 3 modules
- API additions (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Cross-layer changes (model + service + serializer + API)
- Tickets that already have `docs/specs/<TICKET-ID>.md` —
  treat this as a strong signal SPDD is in use for this project

**Detection heuristics (apply in order):**

1. If `docs/specs/<TICKET-ID>.md` exists for any source ticket,
   set `structured_spec_candidate = true`.
2. Else, count `## Files Changed` (or `Implementation Steps`)
   entries in the ticket body. If ≥ 3 distinct top-level paths
   are listed across files in different bounded contexts (e.g.,
   `src/payments/` AND `src/quotes/` AND `src/api/`), set
   `structured_spec_candidate = true`.
3. Else, `structured_spec_candidate = false` — proceed to the
   default play.

**Phase 3 gate behaviour:**

- When `structured_spec_candidate = true`, call
  `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="strategy_choice",
  context={})` in Phase 3 and branch on `effect`:
  - `ask` — **REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** with options:
    - **Use structured-spec play (Recommended)** — full SPDD pipeline
      with scope-with-reasons → spec-update gate → implement →
      spec-sync gate before merge.
    - **Use the default play** — feature / bugfix / etc.
  - `auto-advance` — take the **Recommended** option, skip the
    prompt, and surface the returned `record` line.
  - `skip` — the default play applies silently.
- When the candidate flag is false, the gate does not fire — the
  default play applies silently.

Store the decision in the Phase 1 output as `play_override`. Phase
3 uses it to resolve which play to instantiate.

### Ambiguous Input Fallback (GH-886)

When ALL inputs classify as `note` (no URLs, ticket IDs, or PR
numbers matched), the user likely provided natural language
(e.g., "fix the retry logic", "add dark mode support"). This
is a valid entry point — do not reject it.

**Pure-question confirmation (GH-865):** If the all-`note` input
reads as a question or investigation ask (interrogative phrasing —
"what / why / how does…", "explain…"), **REQUIRED: Call
`AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text): "This looks like a
question, not artifact work — just answer, or start the full
work-on plan?". Proceed with the fallback path below only when the
user picks the full plan. This
edge case applies **only** when no artifact target is present in
the input — when a ticket / PR / URL is present, the question is
context and the full workflow runs without asking (see § Embedded
Questions Are Side Quests).

**Fallback path:**

1. **Search for matching tickets** — use
   `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker` with keywords
   extracted from the input. If a matching open ticket is found,
   reclassify the input as that ticket type.
2. **If no ticket found** — present options via
   `AskUserQuestion`:
   - **Work without a ticket (Recommended)** — proceed as
     `local-only` work type with the note as context
   - **Create a ticket first** — delegate to
     `Dev10x:ticket-create` and re-classify
   - **Search again with different terms** — user provides
     refined search terms

3. **If ticket found** — confirm with the user:
   "Found ticket [ID]: [title]. Use this?" and reclassify
   on confirmation.

**Skip this fallback** when at least one input classified as
a recognized type (URL, ticket ID, PR number). Mixed inputs
(ticket + notes) are handled normally — the notes provide
additional context.

### Early Workspace Decision

After classification, determine whether a branch is needed and
what workspace state we're in. This decision happens early because
it affects Phase 3 planning.

**Decision matrix:**

| Work type | Branch required? | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Ticket (feature/bugfix) | Yes | PR is the goal |
| PR continuation | No | Branch already exists |
| Local-only (free text) | Deferred | Decided in Phase 4 |
| Investigation only | No | No code changes expected |

**Detect current workspace state** via `Dev10x:gh-context` (GH-55 F5):

Call `Skill(Dev10x:gh-context)` and read `worktree`, `current_branch`
from the response. The skill encapsulates the `.git`-file-vs-directory
check and branch lookup; calling raw `git symbolic-ref` /
`git status` here triggers permission friction (chained shell
patterns, `git -C` rejection) that the wrapper avoids.

Fallback (only when `Dev10x:gh-context` is unavailable):
- If `.git` is a **file** (not directory) → worktree
- If `.git` is a **directory** → main repo
- Current branch: `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` (single command,
  no chaining)

**Worktree branch check:** If the CWD is a worktree and the
current branch is a generic worktree branch (e.g., `wt/<name>`
or matches the worktree directory name but has no ticket ID),
flag it for replacement. A work-specific branch must be created
before any commits:

| Workspace state | Branch pattern | Action |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Main repo, on develop | Any ticket | Create branch (Phase 4.1) |
| Main repo, on feature branch | Matching ticket | Reuse branch |
| Worktree, generic WT branch | Any ticket | Create work-specific branch (Phase 4.1) |
| Worktree, matching feature branch | Same ticket | Reuse branch |

Store the workspace decision in the Phase 1 output so Phase 3
can include or skip the workspace setup subtask.

### Self-Check Before Phase 2

**REQUIRED — call `TaskList` now (GH-55 F2).** This is not an
admonition you can skip "because the tasks were obviously
created"; the explicit `TaskList` call is the audit trail. After
calling it, verify exactly 4 phase parents (Phase 1 through
Phase 4) exist. If fewer than 4 are present, create the missing
ones before proceeding.

**Anti-pattern (GH-729, GH-928, GH-55 F2):** Skipping the
`TaskList` call because "I just created the tasks one tool-call
ago" is exactly the regression the audit caught. Run it.

**When the task tools are absent, run anyway (GH-1055).** They
ship by default only on Claude 3.x, Opus 4–4.7, Sonnet 4–4.6 and
Haiku 4.5; a newer or unrecognised model omits them unless the
user opts in, so this is a supported configuration and not a
broken one. Stopping there would refuse to run the orchestrator
on the models it will most often meet. Carry the phase plan as a
written checklist in the transcript instead and close with an
explicit `Verify AC` section — the contract, what it costs, and
what still works are in `.claude/rules/essentials.md` § When the
task tools are absent. The `TaskList` self-check does not apply
in that mode: it audits a mechanism this session does not have,
and an audit of an absent thing can only fail.

**A tool that is present and fails is a different case.** When
`TaskCreate` is offered and the call errors, nothing about the
session says the tools were left out — something is broken, and
degrading past it silently hides a fault the supervisor needs to
hear about. Report the error and stop, as before. Absence is read
from the tool not being available at all, never from a failed
call.

Phase 0.5 needs the same reading. Its resume signature is "the
persisted plan holds tasks but `TaskList` is empty" — on a model
without the tools the `TaskCreate|TaskUpdate` hook matchers never
fire, so `plan.tasks` is always empty and the signature can never
match. That is correct behaviour, not a failed resume: there is
no task tree to rebuild. The plan-sync **context** still
rehydrates, because `plan_sync_*` are MCP tools.

---

## Phase 2: Gather (Quick & Parallel via Subagents)

**Same-session continuity:** If the user already provided rich
context in the current session (e.g., prior investigation, code
exploration, or a detailed description that covers the same
sources), skip redundant API fetches. Re-use context that is
already in the conversation window. Only fetch sources whose
data is not yet available in the session.

Fetch context from all sources in parallel using subagents.
Each subagent receives only its source identifiers and returns
a structured summary — keeping the main session lean.

See `references/task-orchestration.md` Pattern 4 (Subagent
Dispatch) for the full pattern.

### Subtask Creation

**REQUIRED before any `Agent(...)` dispatch (GH-55 F3).** Create
one subtask per source under the Phase 2 parent. The subtasks are
the supervisor's view of in-flight fetches; if you skip them, the
parent shows "in progress" with no breakdown of what is running.

```
TaskCreate(subject="Fetch linear-ticket DEV-42",
    parentTaskId=phase2TaskId)
TaskCreate(subject="Fetch sentry-issue #5201839452",
    parentTaskId=phase2TaskId)
TaskCreate(subject="Fetch slack-thread #channel",
    parentTaskId=phase2TaskId)
```

Mark each subtask `completed` as its subagent returns.
After cross-reference expansion, create additional subtasks
for newly discovered sources.

### Subagent Dispatch

Dispatch one subagent per source in a single tool-call block.
Choose the agent type based on the source's tool requirements:

| Source type | Agent type | Why |
|-------------|-----------|-----|
| `github-issue` | `general-purpose` | Needs Bash for `gh` CLI |
| `github-pr` | `general-purpose` | Needs Bash for `gh` CLI |
| `linear-ticket` | `general-purpose` | Needs Linear MCP tools |
| `jira-ticket` | `general-purpose` | Needs Bash for `Dev10x:jira` skill |
| `slack-thread` | `general-purpose` | Needs Slack MCP tools |
| `sentry-issue` | `general-purpose` | Needs Sentry MCP tools |
| `note` | (none) | Pass through as-is |

**Do NOT use Explore agents for source fetches.** Explore agents
lack access to Bash, MCP tools, and `WebFetch`. Since `gh` CLI
requires Bash and Linear/Slack/Sentry require MCP tools, all
source fetches must use `general-purpose` agents.

**Anti-pattern (PROHIBITED, GH-55 F1):**
```
Agent(subagent_type=Explore, description="Fetch GH-N", ...)
```
This pattern caused a regression where the agent had to be
interrupted by the user and redirected via
`/Dev10x:diag-friction` mid-Phase 2. Source fetch agents
need Bash + MCP — Explore is only for read-only filesystem search.

```
# Single tool-call block — all launch concurrently
Agent(subagent_type=source_agent_type,  # see table above
    model="haiku",                      # Gather tier — context fetch only
    description=f"Fetch {source.type} {source.id}",
    prompt=f"""Fetch context for {source.type}: {source.id}
    {source_specific_instructions}
    Return a structured summary:
    - Title/subject
    - Status (open/closed/merged)
    - Key details (2-3 sentences)
    - Cross-references found (URLs, ticket IDs)
    Do NOT return full body text — summarize.

    Report your final status as the LAST line of your output,
    with exactly one of these prefixes:

    - DONE                           — fetch complete
    - DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: <text>     — fetched but flagged (e.g.,
                                       ticket closed, conflicting info)
    - NEEDS_CONTEXT: <what>          — missing identifier, ambiguous
                                       slug, etc.
    - BLOCKED: <reason>              — permission wall, MCP unavailable,
                                       auth error

    Do not write anything after the status line.

    Your plain-text output is NOT delivered to the orchestrator when
    you run in the background — it only sees an idle notification with
    no content. Deliver your report by calling
    SendMessage(to="main", summary="<5 words>", message=<full report
    ending with your status line>). If it exceeds one message, split
    into labeled parts. Fallback: Write the report to your scratchpad
    path and send a one-line SendMessage confirming the path.""",
    run_in_background=true)
```

**Delivery is mandatory for background dispatch (GH-776).** Because
these agents run with `run_in_background=true`, their final text is
never delivered on its own — the trailing status line rides inside a
`SendMessage(to="main", …)` payload. An `idle_notification` with no
content means the agent finished WITHOUT delivering; escalate per the
ladder in `references/orchestration/subagent-status-protocol.md`
(§ Delivery channel): one nudge → file fallback → `TaskStop`. The
canonical instruction text is `BACKGROUND_DELIVERY_TEMPLATE` in
`dev10x.skills.orchestration.subagent_protocol`.

**Recipient addressing (GH-848 F1).** `to="main"` is the default, but
some harness configs reject it with "Send to a named agent instead".
If the orchestrator runs under a name, state that name in the dispatch
prompt so the agent addresses it directly; on rejection the agent must
retry with the actual orchestrator name/ID, not the literal `"main"`.
See § Addressing the orchestrator in the protocol reference.

**Parse the trailing status line** per
`references/orchestration/subagent-status-protocol.md` (GH-69):

- `DONE` → mark the source's subtask `completed`, fold the summary
  into the Context Summary
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: <text>` → mark `completed`, queue the
  concern for the batched decision presentation in Phase 3
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT: <what>` → re-dispatch once with the requested
  context inlined (e.g., a corrected ticket ID)
- `BLOCKED: <reason>` → run the fetch in the main session as a
  fallback (`gh issue view`, Linear MCP, etc.) and surface the
  reason to the user; do not silently drop the source

**Inline-context defaults (GH-69):** When the controller already
holds file content the subagent needs (e.g., a local PR diff, a
ticket body fetched earlier in this session), prefer inlining
it under `<file path="...">...</file>` blocks rather than
instructing the subagent to Read it. Subagents do not inherit
the controller's `mode: "dontAsk"` permission, so dynamic Reads
stall on permission prompts that the user cannot answer.
Inline-context is the default for Gather, Replicate, and
Analyze tier dispatches (see `.claude/rules/model-selection.md`).

**Web URLs** (documentation, reference pages) should be fetched
in the main session via `WebFetch`, not dispatched to subagents.

### Source-Specific Instructions

| Source type | Agent type | Subagent instructions |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|

### Cross-Reference Expansion (One Level)

After the initial fetch, scan all gathered text for references
to other sources. Add them to the sources list and fetch:

- **PR body** mentions `Fixes: GH-N` or `Fixes: TEAM-N` → fetch that ticket
- **Ticket body** contains Sentry URL → fetch that Sentry issue
- **Ticket body** mentions PR `#N` or branch name → fetch that PR
- **Linear ticket** has parent or relations → fetch related tickets
- **Ticket comments** contain any of the above patterns → fetch

Do NOT expand beyond one level — keep the gathering phase fast.

## Phase 3: Plan (Lightweight Steps)

**Phase 3 is a MECHANICAL step, not a creative step.** Read the
playbook YAML, find the matching play, and convert each step to a
`TaskCreate` call. Do NOT generate a custom plan. Do NOT use
`Agent(Plan)` subagents. The playbook IS the plan — your job is
to instantiate it as tasks.

**REQUIRED: Create exactly one `TaskCreate` per play step.** Do
not collapse, merge, or abbreviate steps. Each step in the
approved play template becomes one task — this is the supervisor's
interface for tracking progress and adding work. Collapsing 14
steps into 5 makes the remaining 9 invisible and unexecuted.

**This applies at Phase 3 (task creation), not Phase 4
(execution).** The bugfix play's "Investigate root cause" epic
prompt says "skip sub-steps if root cause is obvious" — that
guidance applies when *expanding* the epic in Phase 4. In Phase
3, ALL play steps MUST become `TaskCreate` calls regardless of
how obvious the fix seems. The task list is created first; the
agent adapts during execution.

**Anti-pattern (GH-729, GH-928):** A session collapsed
"Reproduce the issue", "Investigate root cause", and "Implement
fix" into a single task "Investigate and implement fix" because
the root cause seemed obvious. Session `da0d9c73` repeated
this — creating 12 tasks instead of 14 and skipping the
TaskList self-check entirely. This is a Phase 3 violation.
All play steps MUST become tasks even if Phase 4 execution
skips sub-steps.

The task list is the supervisor's interface for tracking progress
and adding new tasks during the session.

### Step Types

- **Detailed** — small, immediately executable (2-5 min).
  Created with `metadata: {"type": "detailed"}`.
- **Epic** — placeholder for a phase expanded when reached.
  Created with `metadata: {"type": "epic"}`. Description says
  what the phase accomplishes, not how.

### Generating the Plan

Play templates are loaded from the `Dev10x:playbook` system.
Each work type has a default play with parent-child steps
that can be overridden per project.

**Play source** (resolved in order — see `references/config-resolution.md`):
1. `.claude/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml` — project-local override
2. `~/.config/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml` — global with repo
   matching (get repo via `git remote get-url origin`, walk
   `projects[].match` globs, use first hit's `overrides`/`fragments`);
   fall back to `~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml` for
   backwards compatibility when the XDG path is absent.
3. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/playbook/references/playbook.yaml`

**Playbook schema:** See the `Dev10x:playbook` skill's
`references/playbook.yaml` for the full schema with all 5 plays.
Users can customize plays interactively via
`/Dev10x:playbook edit work-on <play>`.

Each play has:
- `prompt` — heuristic guidance for when this play applies and
  how to adapt it based on gathered context (optional)
- `steps` — ordered list of play steps

Each step in the play has:
- `subject` — task title (required)
- `type` — `detailed` or `epic` (required)
- `prompt` — expansion guidance for the agent executing this
  step; describes what to do, what to look for, or how to
  adapt the step based on context (optional)
- `agent` — agent name to invoke when executing this step (optional)
- `skills` — list of skills to delegate to (optional)
- `steps` — child steps for pre-templated epic expansion (optional)
- `condition` — hint for conditional execution (optional)

### Self-Check Before Plan Generation

**REQUIRED:** Before generating any tasks, you MUST have read
a playbook file. Call `Read` on the playbook path and verify
you received YAML content with a `defaults:` key containing
play definitions. If you cannot confirm this, STOP.

**Resolution probing — DO NOT use `ls` or `cat` (GH-165):**

```bash
# ❌ FORBIDDEN — chained probes shift the allow-rule prefix
ls /work/.../playbooks 2>/dev/null; ls ~/.claude/memory/...
cat ~/.config/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml

# ✅ REQUIRED — use Read with absolute paths, one call per tier
Read(file_path="/abs/path/.claude/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml")
Read(file_path="/home/<user>/.config/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml")
Read(file_path="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/playbook/references/playbook.yaml")
```

The `ls; ls` pattern triggers `PREFIX_POISONED_CHAIN` friction
and the bare `cat` triggers `MISSING_RULE` friction (audit
GH-165). The `Read` tool returns the file content or a clear
"File does not exist" error, which is the only signal the
resolution algorithm needs.

**Loading the play:**
1. Determine the `work_type` from gathered context (see table below)
2. Resolve the playbook using the 3-tier resolution order above:
   a. Try `.claude/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml` (project-local)
   b. Try `~/.config/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml` (global); if
      absent, fall back to `~/.claude/memory/Dev10x/playbooks/work-on.yaml`
      for backwards compatibility — if found (either path), get repo
      via `git remote get-url origin`, walk `projects[].match` globs;
      use first matching entry's config.
      Top-level `fragments` are shared across all matched projects.
   c. Fall back to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/playbook/references/playbook.yaml`
3. **VERIFY: Confirm the playbook loaded successfully.** Check that
   the read returned YAML with play steps present (either under
   `defaults.<work_type>.steps`, `overrides[].steps`, or
   `projects[].overrides[].steps`).
   If ALL paths fail (file missing or unreadable), STOP and report
   the error to the user. Do NOT fall back to generating an ad-hoc
   plan. The playbook IS the plan — without it, Phase 3 cannot
   produce a correct task list.
   **Unmatched play fallback:** If the playbook loaded successfully
   but no play matches the detected `work_type`, fall back to the
   `feature` play (which has the most complete shipping pipeline).
   Do NOT generate an ad-hoc plan — ad-hoc plans lack `skills:`
   fields on steps, causing agents to bypass skill wrappers and
   miss guardrails (gitmoji, JTBD, Fixes links, CI monitoring).
   Log the mismatch: "No play for work_type='{type}', falling
   back to 'feature' play."
4. Resolve: overrides first (same as acceptance-criteria), then
   defaults, then schema fallback
5. **Resolve fragment references:** Walk the step list. When a
   step has `fragment: <name>`, look up the name first in the
   user override file's `fragments` map, then in the default
   playbook's `fragments` map (user fragments shadow defaults).
   Replace the reference with the fragment's steps, applying
   any `condition` override from the reference to each expanded
   step. Error on missing fragments; detect circular refs
   (max depth 3).
6. **Apply active modes:** Read the resolved `active_modes` — the
   matching `projects[]` entry of `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml`,
   falling back to its `defaults:` block (ADR-0018) — and the project
   playbook file. For each step with a `modes:` mapping:
   - If any active mode says `skip`, remove the step
   - Otherwise merge field overrides from active modes
     (last-listed mode wins on conflicts)
   - Apply `mode_extensions` from project file on top
   See `references/execution-modes.md` for precedence rules.
7. There is no friction pass. A step states its behaviour in its
   own `prompt`; the one baseline answers gate pacing for every
   step alike (ADR-0022, GH-1171). A `friction:` mapping on a
   step is a leftover from the three-preset world — ignore it and
   report it, rather than resolving it.
8. For each remaining step, create a `TaskCreate` with the
   step's `subject`, `type` in metadata, and `agent`/`skills`
   in metadata if present
9. If a step has child `steps`, store them in metadata for
   expansion when the epic is reached (Phase 4)
10. **VERIFY: Call `TaskList` and count Phase 4 subtasks.** The
    count must match the number of steps after mode resolution
    (not the raw play step count). If fewer tasks
    exist than resolved steps, go back and create the missing
    ones. **DO NOT mark Phase 3 complete until this count
    matches.** The VERIFY is not optional — skipping it is a
    Phase 3 compliance violation (GH-729, GH-928). Example: the
    bugfix
    play with `shipping-pipeline-solo` fragment produces 14
    steps. If `TaskList` shows fewer than 14 Phase 4 subtasks,
    you skipped or collapsed steps — create them now.

**Work type classification:**

| Context | Work type |
|---------|-----------|
| Ticket with implementation | `feature` |
| Sentry/bug ticket | `bugfix` |
| PR with review comments | `pr-continuation` |
| No ticket, no PR | `local-only` |
| Sentry/Slack only, no fix planned | `investigation` |

**Workspace step adjustment:** If Phase 1 detected a matching
feature branch already exists, skip the "Set up workspace" step.
If running in a worktree with a generic branch, keep it.

These plan steps become subtasks of the Phase 4 top-level task.
The last subtask is always acceptance criteria verification.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

The **last task** in every plan verifies the work is shippable
or ready for handover. This task is the session's terminal
gate — see the empty-task-list invariant above (GH-149). It
remains `pending` (or `in_progress` while the supervisor is
reviewing) until the supervisor explicitly confirms closure.
Never mark Verify-AC `completed` without an explicit supervisor
"ship it" / "looks good" / "close session" / equivalent
affirmation; never mark it `deleted` while pending — that
empties the task list and breaks the invariant.

**Verify-AC summary contents.** When invoked, the verification
must surface a structured summary so the supervisor can confirm
closure without re-reading the conversation:

- PR link(s) and merge state
- Per-ticket: ID, title, link, "addressed by commit(s) …"
- CI status (green/red/pending; link to failing checks)
- Open review comments (count + links) — should be zero to ship
- Working-copy state (clean / staged / uncommitted)
- Acceptance criteria items, each `[x]` or `[ ]`

The supervisor may extend or modify the AC at this point —
treat new instructions as additional tasks inserted **before**
Verify-AC, never as replacements for it.

**REQUIRED:** Delegate to `Dev10x:verify-acc-dod` skill:

1. `Skill(skill="Dev10x:verify-acc-dod", args="<work_type>")`

The skill handles criteria resolution (YAML file, defaults,
overrides), automated state checks (CI, PR, working copy),
and user confirmation. See the `Dev10x:verify-acc-dod` skill
for the full criteria schema and verification protocol.

**Playbook override note:** Solo-maintainer or project-specific
playbook overrides may substitute an inline acceptance prompt
for this delegation. When a playbook step replaces the
`verify-acc-dod` delegation with its own `prompt:`, the inline
prompt is a valid substitution — not a compliance violation.
Skill audits should classify this as COMPLIANT (playbook
substitution), not SKIPPED_STEP.

**Single terminal Verify-AC — collapse adjacent duplicates
(GH-781).** A play must instantiate **exactly one** terminal
`Verify acceptance criteria` task. The bug appears when a play
both composes a shipping fragment (which ends with its own
Verify-AC step) *and* appends a play-level Verify-AC — the
`local-only` play does this, so choosing "create PR" expanded
the fragment and produced two adjacent Verify-AC tasks. The
mechanical-instantiation rule (one TaskCreate per resolved step)
would faithfully create both.

When fragment expansion yields two adjacent Verify-AC steps,
they are NOT co-equal: the fragment's step is the executable DoD
delegation *and* the terminal gate on the PR path, while the
play-level step is the terminal gate on the no-PR path. Collapse
to one by honoring the play-level step's path condition:

- The play-level Verify-AC carries `condition: if-no-pr` (the
  inverse of the fragment's `if-pr-decided`). On the PR path the
  fragment terminates the plan and the play-level duplicate is
  conditioned out; on the no-PR path the fragment is skipped and
  the play-level step is the sole terminal gate.
- If you observe two adjacent Verify-AC tasks after resolution,
  drop the one whose path condition is not satisfied — do not
  create both. This is the one sanctioned exception to strict
  one-TaskCreate-per-step instantiation (GH-729/GH-928), because
  the two steps describe mutually-exclusive paths.

### Example Plays (Defaults)

These are the built-in default plays. Full YAML definitions
with pre-templated epic children live in the `Dev10x:playbook`
skill. Users can customize these via
`/Dev10x:playbook edit work-on <play>`.

**Feature from ticket** (subtasks of Phase 4):

```

**Plan the commit sequence (4.4, GH-904 F1).** Before touching
code, produce an explicit ordered per-commit plan: for each
planned commit, note the gitmoji, the ticket ID, the files it
owns, and which earlier commit(s) it depends on. **Refactor
commits precede feature commits (GH-904 F2)** — reorder the plan
so any pure-refactor commit lands before the feature commit that
depends on it. Implement (4.5) executes this plan; deviations are
expected but should be reconciled back into the plan, not
silently improvised.

**Bug fix from Sentry + ticket:**

**Evidence-first rule:** Before selecting files to edit, review
all gathered evidence (Sentry stack traces, Linear comments,
Slack context). The error location in the stack trace identifies
the failing code path — do NOT skip to implementation based on
the ticket title alone. If Sentry or Linear evidence names a
specific file/line, that is the starting point for investigation.

4.10 [detailed] Verify acceptance criteria
```

**Pr-continuation merge-state guard (GH-744 F1).** Task 4.1
(Fetch PR and review context) MUST resolve the PR's merge state
(`state` / `mergedAt` via `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_get` — not
`pr_detect`, whose payload is not guaranteed to carry `state`,
GH-764 F2) before building the continuation plan. When the PR is
already `MERGED`, do NOT instantiate the full triage → fixup →
re-review plan — collapse to a **post-merge cleanup** scope
(answer any still-unresolved bot/human comments for the record,
then Verify AC). `Dev10x:gh-pr-respond` enforces the same
short-circuit in its Merge-State Check preamble, so a respond
cycle dispatched from 4.3 stays safe even if this guard is
missed; catching it at 4.1 avoids planning work that will be
discarded.

**Pr-continuation deletion guard (GH-117 #1).** Tasks 4.6
(Monitor CI), 4.8 (Update PR description), 4.9 (Request
re-review), and 4.10 (Verify acceptance criteria) MUST NOT be
marked `status=deleted` while still `pending`. The terminal
gate is `Dev10x:verify-acc-dod`, NOT a mid-session pivot to an
inline edit. When the user pivots inside Phase 4 — for example,
"actually, also fix this nit" — the pivot becomes a **new
subtask inserted before 4.10**; it does not replace the existing
Phase 4 plan. Deleting still-pending pr-continuation tasks
empties the task list, kills CI monitoring, and lets unaddressed
review comments slip through. The recurrence in GH-117 evidence
(deletion happened twice in the same session) shows the
regression is easy to repeat under user-pivot pressure.

**Post-push auto-advance (GH-117 #2).** After
`Skill(Dev10x:git)` returns a successful push on a branch that
already has an open PR, the next active task is **always**
`Monitor CI`. Move task 4.6 to `in_progress` immediately on
push success — do not wait for the user to ask "did CI run?".
A missed CI failure on an unattended post-push is documented as
the most common pr-continuation oversight; auto-moving the
monitor task converts it from oversight to deviation (visible
in `TaskList`).

The structured-spec play differs from `feature` in two ways:

1. **Scope step uses REASONS sections** — `Dev10x:ticket-scope`
   renders Entities / Norms / Safeguards via the autopopulator
   (GH-170) so the saved spec at `docs/specs/<TICKET-ID>.md` is
   the single source of truth.
2. **Two drift-detection gates bracket Implement** — the
   spec-update gate (4.4) catches behaviour changes mid-flight;
   the spec-sync gate (4.9) catches structural drift before
   merge. Both use `dev10x.spec.drift_detector` so they agree.

**Plan the commit sequence (4.5, GH-904 F1).** Same contract as
the `feature` play: an explicit ordered per-commit plan (gitmoji,
ticket ID, owned files, dependencies), with **refactor commits
preceding feature commits (GH-904 F2)**. This plan folds into the
saved spec at `docs/specs/<TICKET-ID>.md` — record it there (e.g.
as a checklist under Implementation Steps) rather than as a
throwaway note, so it survives the spec-sync gate.

### Supervisor Approval Gate

Present the plan as a **box-drawing tree** (Hybrid display
convention, GH-730): phases are top-level nodes and their
subtasks nest beneath them with box-drawing glyphs, preserving
the Phase → subtask structure that a flat numbered list
flattens away. The tree is **presentation only** — the plan
still feeds the same `TaskCreate` calls regardless of how it is
rendered, so the approval logic below is unchanged.

Template:

```
Phase 4: Execute <work-type>

```

Use `├─` for every node except the last at a given depth, `└─`
for the last node, and `│` to carry the parent's vertical run
across a nested block. Flat two-level output (e.g., the Session
mode summary below) keeps its bullet-indent form — see
[`references/display-conventions.md`](../../references/display-conventions.md)
for the full hybrid convention.

**Implicit approval bypass:** Skip `AskUserQuestion` ONLY when
ALL three conditions are met:
1. User input contains **numbered steps** (not just a list of
   tickets, URLs, or a prose description)
2. The steps explicitly cover **deliverables**, **verification**,
   AND **integration/shipping** (commit, PR, merge)
3. The steps are **actionable as-is** — not "investigate X" or
   "fix the issues" but concrete actions like "add retry logic
   to payments/service.py"

A list of ticket URLs, a vague description, or bullet points
without shipping steps does NOT qualify — always present the
plan gate in those cases.

**Natural language mapping:** User phrases like "prepare a draft",
"for my approval", "let me review first", "show me the plan", or
"what's the plan" all map to THIS gate. Present the plan via
`AskUserQuestion` — do not write a document, create a plan file,
or use Claude Code's built-in plan mode.

### Session Mode Summary (GH-189)

**REQUIRED: Display the resolved session mode** immediately
before any plan-approval gate, including when the gate is
bypassed via an `auto-advance` effect. The block makes
autonomous behavior auditable upfront — without it, supervisors
cannot tell whether the session will auto-merge or pause for
confirmation, which is the visibility gap GH-189 closes.

Gather the three facts through their owning tools — never by
reading `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml` yourself:

1. `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__supervisor_review_status()` →
   `supervisor_review` (`required` / `none`) and `pinned`.
2. `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__preset_pin_status()` → `prefs`, whose
   `gate_overlays` names the active overlays and whose
   `gate_overrides` names any per-gate deviation.
3. `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="merge", context={})`
   → whether this session ends by merging on its own.

Then print:

```
Session mode summary
  Baseline: adaptive (every gate auto-advances unless a floor,
    a project pin, or an override says otherwise)
  Supervisor review: <required | none> (<where the park lands>)
  Overlays:
    - <overlay-name>
      • <one-line behavior bullet>
  Gate overrides: <toggle>=<value>, … (or "none")
  Merge: <auto-advance | ask | skip> — <what that means here>
```

`adaptive` is the sole shipped baseline (ADR-0022 D-1), so the
baseline line is a constant, not a lookup — there is no
`strict` / `guided` / `adaptive` level to report. For
`supervisor_review`, say where the park lands: `required` parks
before merge in a solo repo and before the team review request in a
team repo (ADR-0022 D-3); `none` removes the supervisor's own park
only — AI self-review and CI still run (ADR-0022 D-4). For each
overlay, inline the documented behavior bullets from
[`references/active-modes.md`](../../references/active-modes.md);
an undocumented name emits a single warning bullet ("overlay not
documented — verify with `Dev10x:playbook`") rather than failing.

**Contradiction warning (GH-744 F3).** Oversight overlays that force
checkpoints — `supervised` and `pair-review` — oppose an autonomous
posture. When either is active alongside the `afk` overlay, append a
warning line so the contradiction is visible before the plan gate:

```
  ⚠ Contradiction: <overlay> forces checkpoints but the session is
    walk-away — every gate will still fire. Drop <overlay>
    (e.g., re-run Dev10x:afk, which reconciles it) or drop `afk`.
```

This was the root cause of every gate firing during an
intended-AFK session (GH-744 F3): the oversight overlays silently
outranked the adaptive intent with no surfaced contradiction. The
warning is advisory — it does not block; `resolve_gate` still
governs actual gate behavior.

**This block is display-only (GH-189).** Nothing it prints decides
anything. `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate` (ADR-0016) reads
session policy (baseline, overlays, project pin, session overrides,
`supervisor_review`, plus the safety floors) itself and is the single
source of truth for whether any gate below fires or auto-advances.
Do not re-derive an auto-approve or bypass decision from a policy
value in prose.

Print this block once per session, immediately after the
context summary and before the plan-approval gate. Subsequent
re-invocations within the same session may omit the block when
the persisted plan-sync context already shows the modes are
unchanged.

**Plan-approval gate (`plan_approval`).** When the plan was
agent-generated (skip entirely under the "Implicit approval
bypass" conditions above — no gate fires there at any friction
level), call
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="plan_approval")` and
branch on `effect`:

1. `effect == "ask"` — **REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT
   use plain text):
   `AskUserQuestion(questions=[{question: "How would you like to proceed with the work plan?", header: "Plan", options: [{label: "Approve (Recommended)", description: "Start execution immediately"}, {label: "Edit", description: "Describe what to change (add/remove/reorder steps)"}], multiSelect: false}])`
2. `effect == "auto-advance"` — do not call `AskUserQuestion`, do not
   present the plan as prose for approval. Auto-select "Approve" and
   proceed directly to Phase 4. Surface the returned `record` line
   (e.g. `⚙ gate:plan_approval → "Approve" (reason)`) in the
   transcript so a present supervisor can veto. Safety floors
   (destructive/irreversible/blocking work) make the resolver return
   `ask` regardless of preset — this branch only fires when the
   resolver itself judged the plan safe to auto-approve. This
   supersedes the old `adaptive`+`solo-maintainer` and `auto-plan`
   bypass rules; every **downstream** decision gate (epic A/B forks,
   strategy/batch gates, the Plan Completion Gate) resolves
   independently via its own `resolve_gate` call — an auto-advance
   here does NOT license skipping them.
3. `effect == "skip"` — skip the gate entirely, no prompt, no
   auto-approve announcement.
4. Response has an `error` key — fail safe: treat as `ask` and fire
   the `AskUserQuestion` widget in step 1.

After approval (explicit or auto-advanced), set task
dependencies where appropriate (use `TaskUpdate` with
`addBlockedBy`). Mark the first task as `in_progress` and
begin Phase 4.

### Persist Plan Context

**REQUIRED after plan approval (GH-760 F2).** Execute these
calls immediately — do NOT defer or skip:

1. `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__plan_sync_set_context(args=["work_type=<detected_work_type>", "tickets=<JSON array of ticket IDs>", "routing_table={\"commit\":\"Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)\",\"create_pr\":\"Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-create)\",\"monitor_ci\":\"Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)\",\"monitor_pr\":\"Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)\",\"push\":\"Skill(Dev10x:git)\",\"groom\":\"Skill(Dev10x:git-groom)\",\"branch\":\"Skill(Dev10x:ticket-branch)\",\"verify_acceptance\":\"Skill(Dev10x:verify-acc-dod)\",\"merge_pr\":\"Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-merge)\",\"work_on\":\"work-on\"}"])`
2. `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__plan_sync_set_context(args=["gathered_summary=<1-3 sentence summary>"])`
3. **When bundling (GH-196):** `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__plan_sync_set_context(args=["bundling=true", "batches=<JSON array of arrays, e.g. [[\"GH-12\",\"GH-14\"],[\"GH-21\"]]>"])`. Skip this call entirely when `tickets` has fewer than 2 ticket IDs or the user chose Strategy A (fanout). When skipped, downstream consumers treat the absence as `bundling=false`.

**Session identity needs no separate write (GH-755, retired by
ADR-0018).** The `tickets=` and `branch` values persisted by the
plan-sync calls above ARE the freshness inputs the Phase 0
`session_adoption` gate reads on the next same-branch invocation —
`_computed_session_stale()` derives staleness from the plan-sync
identity, not from any per-repo file. The original GH-755 step wrote
them a second time into `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml`; that file is
retired, the write trips the self-settings consent gate, and nothing
reads it back in a repo with a `friction.yaml` entry. Do not perform
it — the plan-sync calls above are the whole of the identity write.

**Attribution keys (GH-152):** The `work_on` key with value
`"work-on"` is the audit attribution string — skill audits
match on this exact value to confirm `Dev10x:work-on`
orchestrated the plan. Include both `monitor_ci` and
`monitor_pr` keys with the same value so callers can use
either name without losing the routing.

This ensures the PreCompact hook can inject the routing table
and work type into the recovery context. Without this, the
agent loses skill-to-action mappings after compaction (GH-477).
Prior code-block formatting was treated as advisory — the
numbered list enforces execution per
`skill-orchestration-format.md`.

---

## Phase 4: Execute (Adaptive, Auto-Advance)

Work through the approved task list. Update task status via
`TaskUpdate` as work progresses.

### Mid-Execution Interrupt Classification (GH-229)

When a new supervisor message arrives while a Phase 4 task is
`in_progress`, classify it before deciding whether to pause.
The default is to keep working; only the signals in the **pause**
column below justify stopping.

| Signal type | Classification | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Explicit stop word ("stop", "pause", "wait", "hold on") | Pause | Stop the in-progress task, mark `pending`, ask what changed |
| In-flight correction of the current action ("not that file", "wrong approach") | Pause | Stop, address the correction, resume |
| `Dev10x:session-wrap-up` invocation | Pause | Hand off to wrap-up |
| `ALWAYS_ASK` gate firing | Pause | Honor the gate per its REQUIRED marker |
| `<local-command-stdout>` block from a slash command | **Ambient chatter** | Continue — the user ran a side command, not a directive |
| One-word ack ("ok", "k", "thanks", "👍") | **Ambient chatter** | Continue — acknowledgment, not a stop signal |
| Conversational check-in ("how's it going?", "still working?") | **Ambient chatter** | Continue; answer briefly in the next status update |
| New task scoped to the same plan ("also fix X") | Append, don't pause | Add via `TaskCreate` before Verify-AC; continue current task |
| New ticket URL / Slack thread unrelated to current plan | Queue, don't pause | Append as a TODO; raise after current task completes |

**Anti-pattern (GH-229):** Under `adaptive` friction, the agent
stopped on an ambient `<local-command-stdout>` block + one-word
check-in and waited for the supervisor to ask "are you working
or pausing?". Slash-command stdout is the user's side command
running; one-word acks are acknowledgment, not stop intent.
Neither row above maps either signal to "pause".

When in doubt at `adaptive`, default to **continue and post a
brief status line** rather than pausing. The supervisor can
explicitly stop you if needed — silence is consent to continue.

### Progress Compaction

After completing each phase boundary (e.g., all gather subtasks,
all implementation subtasks), compact completed tasks into a brief
summary via `TaskUpdate` metadata. This frees context window for
remaining work. See `references/task-orchestration.md` Pattern 8
for the full compaction protocol.

### Context Fill Monitoring (GH-884)

**Advisory check at phase boundaries.** Quality degrades when
context utilization exceeds ~40%. Check context fill at these
transition points:

| Transition | When |
|-----------|------|
| Phase 2 → Phase 3 | After all gather subagents return |
| Phase 3 → Phase 4 | After plan approval |
| Mid-Phase 4 | After completing implementation epic |

**Check method:** Approximate context fill from conversation
length. If the Claude Code harness exposes token count or
context utilization, use it directly. Otherwise estimate from
message count and tool result sizes.

**When context exceeds 40%:**
1. Log: "Context fill ~{N}% — consider mitigation"
2. **Recommended mitigations:**
   - Delegate remaining implementation to subagents (use
     haiku for data collection, sonnet for analysis)
   - Compact completed task metadata (Pattern 8)
   - For large remaining work: spawn a fresh session with
     `Dev10x:session-wrap-up` + resume instructions
3. Do NOT block execution — this is advisory. Some tasks
   legitimately need deep context (e.g., cross-cutting
   refactors spanning many files).

**Skip when:** Session has fewer than 10 tool calls (too
early to measure meaningfully).

### Skill Routing Enforcement

**Hard rule — applies to ALL plans and ALL work types
(feature, bugfix, local-only, investigation, pr-continuation):**

| Action | MUST delegate to | Never use directly |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Run tests — EVERY run, incl. narrow ones | `Skill(test)` | `pytest`, `uv run pytest`, `python -m pytest` |
| Create a commit | `Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)` | `git commit` |
| Create a PR | `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-create)` | `gh pr create` |
| Monitor CI | `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` | `gh pr checks --watch` |
| Push to remote | `Skill(Dev10x:git)` | `git push` |
| Groom history | `Skill(Dev10x:git-groom)` | `git rebase -i`, `git develop-log` for assessment |
| Create branch | `Skill(Dev10x:ticket-branch)` | `git checkout -b` |
| Create a skill | `Skill(Dev10x:skill-create)` | Writing SKILL.md directly |
| Check PR state | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_detect` | `gh pr view --json` |
| Verify PR readiness | `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__verify_pr_state` | `gh pr checks` |
| Verify acceptance criteria | `Skill(Dev10x:verify-acc-dod)` | Inline checks |
| Merge PR | `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-merge)` | `gh pr merge`, `git merge` |

This table survives context compaction — it is the canonical
routing for shipping actions. If you are about to run a raw
git/gh command that appears in the "Never use directly" column,
STOP and invoke the corresponding skill instead.

**Full-suite gate before declaring a work item done (GH-876 F1).**
The `Run tests` verification that gates commit / PR / task-completion
MUST run the COMPLETE test suite with coverage — never only the
subset covering edited files. A subset-green run misses regressions
in unedited callers and the 100%-coverage gate; those then fail in
CI after the item was already reported done. Narrow `Skill(test)`
args (e.g. `-k` / a path) are fine for fast inner-loop iteration,
but the final pre-commit / pre-DONE verification runs the full
suite with no path-narrowing args.

**The wrapper is not the gate wearing a wrapper (GH-1337).** The
`Run tests` row binds EVERY run, including each iteration of an
edit-run-edit loop. Reading it as "route the run that gates DONE" is
the misreading that produced six raw invocations in one audited
session. A narrow routed run is the cheaper of the two calls:

- `-k <expr>` / a path → `run_tests(args=["-k", "<expr>"])`
- `--no-cov` → `coverage=false`
- `--extra dev` → drop it; the tool resolves the extra itself

`pytest-inner-loop` (DX006) blocks the narrow raw shape and carries
that translation, so a slip is caught at the call rather than at the
terminal DoD check — which runs after the work merged. The
full-coverage raw form stays unblocked: it is `Dev10x:py-test`'s
fallback when no MCP server is reachable, and the shape that seeds a
fresh worktree's virtualenv.

**Compaction preservation (CRITICAL):** When context is
compacted, the summary MUST retain this routing table
verbatim. Without it, the agent loses skill-to-action
mappings and falls back to raw CLI commands — the #1
source of guardrail bypasses (24% compliance in GH-477).
Re-inject the table into the compacted context as a
**numbered list** (not a code block — code blocks are treated
as advisory examples per `skill-orchestration-format.md`).
**Self-check after compaction:** After any context compaction
event, verify the routing table is still present by scanning
for "Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)" in the current context. If
missing, re-read this section before proceeding.

1. run tests → `Skill(test)`
2. commit → `Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)`
3. create PR → `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-create)`
4. monitor CI → `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)`
5. push → `Skill(Dev10x:git)`
6. groom → `Skill(Dev10x:git-groom)`
7. branch → `Skill(Dev10x:ticket-branch)`
8. create skill → `Skill(Dev10x:skill-create)`
9. check PR state → `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_detect`
10. verify PR readiness → `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__verify_pr_state`
11. verify acceptance → `Skill(Dev10x:verify-acc-dod)`
12. merge PR → `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-merge)`

### Groom Step: Always Delegate, Never Self-Assess

**Hard rule (GH-505, GH-776, GH-929):** When the plan includes
a "Groom commit history" step, you MUST invoke
`Skill(Dev10x:git-groom)` and let the skill run its own
analysis. **As the orchestrator, outside the skill,** do NOT run
`git develop-log`, `git log`, or any commit inspection to
pre-assess whether grooming is needed — not before invoking the
skill, and not after invoking the skill to override its
decision. The groom skill's Phase 2 strategy gate determines
whether grooming is required — that decision belongs to the
skill, not to the orchestrator.

**Scope of the prohibition (GH-997).** This rule binds the
*caller*, not the callee. `Dev10x:git-groom` Phase 1 opens with
its own `git log` / `git merge-base` analysis — that is the
skill's first documented step, and running it while executing
the skill is compliant, not a violation. Read the rule as: do
not inspect history to **predict** the groom's outcome from
outside; inspection **inside** `Dev10x:git-groom` Phase 1 is the
skill doing its job. Without this scoping the two documents read
as contradictory instructions, which plausibly contributed to
the three recorded recurrences below.

**Anti-pattern (GH-776, GH-929):** The orchestrator
pre-assessed "single commit, nothing to groom" and marked
the task complete without invoking the skill. Session
`da0d9c73` repeated this — third recurrence. Even when the
groom skill is expected to be a no-op, the skill must run
its own logic. The orchestrator must not inspect commit
history to predict the outcome.

### CI Re-Monitoring After Force Push

**Hard rule:** Force push (from `Dev10x:git-groom` or conflict
rebase) invalidates all previous CI results. After any force
push, you MUST re-invoke `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` to
monitor the new CI runs. Do NOT declare CI green based on
pre-groom results — the new HEAD has different commit SHAs
and GitHub runs fresh checks against it.

This applies to the shipping pipeline sequence:
```
... → Groom (force push) → RE-MONITOR CI → Update PR → ...
```

**Merge-state check before re-monitor/rewrite (GH-904 F4).** On
ANY unexpected branch-head change — the local HEAD sha no longer
matches what this session last pushed, most commonly because a
maintainer ran GitHub's "Update branch" button — resolve the PR
merge state via `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_get` (read `state` /
`mergedAt`) BEFORE re-invoking `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` or any
rebase/rewrite. Same pattern as `Dev10x:gh-pr-respond`'s
Merge-State Check preamble. If `state == "MERGED"`, stop — do not
rebase, force-push, or re-monitor a PR that already merged.

### Solo-Maintainer Post-Create Monitor Mandate (GH-185)

**Hard rule:** When `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate=
"request_review", context={})` returns `effect: "skip"` — nobody
else is being asked to look at this PR — the Phase 4 shipping
sequence MUST invoke `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` immediately
after `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-create)` completes (success OR "PR
already exists"). No gate effect suppresses this: an
`auto-advance` elsewhere advances *through* gates, it must never
advance *past* the monitor step. The monitor task remains a
blocking step that runs in the same session, not a deferred
follow-up.

**Anti-pattern (GH-185):** A solo-maintainer + adaptive session
created the PR and returned control to the user without
dispatching the monitor. The user had to prompt explicitly
~40 minutes later; by then the PR had already auto-merged and
the monitor's only remaining work was milestone cleanup (which
hit a separate permission gap — see GH-187).

**Why solo-maintainer is the load-bearing case:** in
team-review sessions, GitHub's review-required gate keeps the
PR open long enough that the monitor catching up later is
harmless. In solo-maintainer mode, there is no review gate,
auto-merge may fire on the next CI tick, and skipping the
monitor means skipping all of Phase 2 (fixup handling),
Phase 3.5 (milestone cleanup), and Phase 4 (acceptance
verification).

The orchestrator MUST NOT mark the shipping phase complete
until `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` has run end-to-end.

### Swarm-Child Auto-Advance (GH-368 F2, GH-385 F1)

**Hard rule:** When the dispatch prompt carries the fanout
swarm-context marker (the `wave_id` line — ADR-0019 / GH-950 keep
swarm-child identity out of every config file), work-on MUST
auto-advance past `Skill(Dev10x:ticket-branch)` without a
continuation prompt. The branch is not a milestone — it is
setup infrastructure. After the branch is created, immediately
proceed to the next Phase 4 step (design or implement).

**Root cause of the stall:** Without this rule, work-on shows
the "branch created" output and waits for the user to say
"continue". In a swarm context, there is no user — the agent
waits indefinitely and terminates when the turn budget
expires, leaving only a branch and no PR.

**Required behavior in swarm-child mode:**
1. `Skill(Dev10x:ticket-branch)` creates the branch.
2. Without any pause, continue to the implementation steps.
3. Run through the full shipping pipeline (commit → push →
   PR → monitor → merge).
4. Only AFTER the PR is merged, emit the terminal status line.

**Terminal status line guarantee (GH-368 F2, GH-385 F1):**
Even if the turn ends before the PR is merged (context limit,
permission wall, or any interruption), the FINAL line of the
agent's output MUST be one of:
- `DONE` — PR merged, CI green, no open comments
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: <text>` — merged but flagged
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT: <what>` — interrupted before merge (include
  the PR URL if it exists so the orchestrator can resume)
- `BLOCKED: <reason>` — cannot proceed

Never end with free-form prose as the last line. The fanout
orchestrator parses the trailing line deterministically and
treats a missing or non-terminal line as `NEEDS_CONTEXT`
(re-dispatch). Swarm agents MUST NOT rely on this fallback —
the status line is their own responsibility.

### Apply Fixups Completion Guard (GH-851 F2)

**Hard rule:** The "Apply fixups" task CANNOT be marked
complete until ALL PR checks — including automated review bots
(claude-review, hygiene-review, openai-review) — have finished.
A monitor returning "CI green" covers only core CI checks. Bot
reviews are separate GitHub check runs that may still be PENDING
when core CI passes. Verify via `gh pr checks` that zero checks
remain in PENDING or IN_PROGRESS state before marking complete.

### Skill Partial-Read Downgrade Prohibition (GH-44)

**Hard rule:** Once you invoke a `Skill()`, you MUST follow its
documented orchestration through to completion. Reading the first
N lines, deciding the skill is "too heavy" or "dispatches a
background agent we don't need", and substituting a "lighter"
direct-CLI alternative is a violation. The skill's design — including
background dispatch, gates, and side effects — is the contract.

**Anti-pattern (GH-44):** Agent invokes
`Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)`, partially reads instructions.md
(e.g., `Read(..., limit=100)`), encounters background-agent
dispatch logic, rationalizes "this is overkill, let me just run
`gh pr checks --watch` synchronously", and bypasses the skill.
The rationalization "auto-advance pressure means I should pick
the lightest path" is exactly what GH-932 warned against:
"unattended mode changes the *pace*, not the *rules*."

**Detection signal:** If you find yourself thinking "this skill
is heavy, let me do simpler X instead" while inside a Skill()
invocation, STOP. Either complete the skill as documented or
abort the invocation explicitly and re-justify the substitution
to the user via `AskUserQuestion`. Silent downgrade is forbidden.

**Read fully before acting:** When delegating to a skill, read
its `instructions.md` to completion (or until you hit the section
relevant to your invocation context) before executing any
substitute. Partial reads followed by substitutions miss
guardrails that appear later in the file.

### Post-PR Review-Comment Routing (GH-43)

**Hard rule:** ANY review comment on the PR — human OR bot
(claude-review, hygiene-review, openai-review) — MUST be
addressed via `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-respond)`. Do NOT use raw
`gh api PATCH`, `gh pr edit`, or `gh pr comment` to "just edit
the PR body" or "just post a quick reply" inline. The
gh-pr-respond skill runs the documented triage → fixup →
resolve flow that bypasses get skipped when the agent edits
directly.

**Anti-pattern (GH-43):** Bot review surfaces "Fix JTBD voice"
on PR body; agent runs `gh api -X PATCH .../pulls/N -F body=@...`
followed by `gh pr comment N --body "..."`. The fix lands but
the skill's triage/fixup/resolve flow is bypassed. The agent
rationalizes "this is a one-liner, the skill is overkill" — that
rationalization is the violation. Skill delegation is mandatory
regardless of the comment's apparent simplicity.

**Detection signal:** If you are about to call `gh api PATCH
.../pulls/`, `gh pr edit`, or `gh pr comment` to respond to a
PR review comment, STOP and invoke `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-respond)`
instead. The skill handles single-comment cases just as well as
batch.

### Auto-Advance Rule

See `references/task-orchestration.md` for the full pattern.

**Complete a task → immediately start the next.** Do not pause
between tasks to ask "should I continue?" or wait for the user
to say "go" / "next" / "continue". The approved plan is the
authorization to proceed — **no checkpoints the resolver did not
ask for**. See `references/friction-levels.md` § "No checkpoints"
rule for the canonical definition of what counts as a checkpoint.

**Auto-advance on commits:** After creating a commit, immediately
proceed to the next task. Never pause to show the commit or ask
for confirmation — the commit is done, move on.

**Auto-advance on code review (GH-932):** When delegating to
`Dev10x:review` from the shipping pipeline, pass
`args="--unattended"` so the skill skips the zero-findings
AskUserQuestion gate and auto-advances to `Dev10x:review-fix`.
Session `da0d9c73` invoked the skill without this flag,
causing it to skip the mandatory attended-mode gate and the
findings file write. The playbook `prompt:` says to use
`--unattended` — this is not advisory, it is required.

**Auto-advance on draft PR creation:** Create the draft PR and
immediately proceed to **Monitor CI** — this is mandatory, not
optional. Do not block on PR preview approval when executing
the shipping pipeline — the PR body and title can always be
updated later via the "Update PR description" step. When
delegating to `Dev10x:gh-pr-create`, pass
`args="--unattended"` to skip the preview gate.

**Hard rule: Always invoke CI monitor after PR creation.**
After `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` completes, the very next action
MUST be `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)`. Do NOT skip this step
even if the PR "looks fine" or CI "should pass." Session
GH-477 showed the monitor was not invoked for 12+ hours after
PR creation, requiring 9 user prompts. The monitor is part of
the shipping pipeline, not an optional convenience.

**Shipping pipeline is atomic — no-checkpoints sequence:** Once
the main implementation and verification are done, the remaining
shipping steps (code review → commit → PR → CI → groom → update
→ ready → merge) form an atomic, no-checkpoints sequence. Auto-
advance through ALL of them without pausing for user input. The
sequence runs end-to-end with zero interruptions other than gates
whose `resolve_gate` effect is `ask`. Do NOT stop
after posting review replies, after creating the PR, after CI
goes green, or after grooming — continue until the plan
completion gate or a genuine blocker (unrecoverable CI,
unresolved human review thread, merge conflict needing judgment).
A trailing "Ready to proceed to the next step?" between any of
these shipping steps is a checkpoint the resolver never asked
for, and is forbidden.

**Batched Decision Queue:** When a task hits a genuine A/B
decision, do NOT interrupt the user immediately. Instead:

1. Queue the decision in task metadata:
   ```
   TaskUpdate(taskId, status="pending",
       metadata={"decision_needed": "description",
                 "options": ["A", "B", "C"]})
   ```
2. Move to the next unblocked task and keep advancing.
3. Only interrupt when ALL tasks are blocked — collect all
   queued decisions into one `AskUserQuestion` batch (1-4 Qs).
4. After the user answers, unblock and resume auto-advancing.

The supervisor can step away, come back to answer all decisions
at once, then step away again confident maximum progress will
happen before the next interruption.

**If blocked on the current task** (waiting for user input,
external dependency, CI), check whether the next unblocked
task can start. Examples:
- Waiting for CI? Start self-review in parallel.
- Waiting for user input on approach? Create the branch or
  draft the Job Story meanwhile.
- Stuck on a sub-task? Mark it `pending` with a note and
  advance to the next unblocked task in the list.

Return to the blocked task once the blocker resolves.

### Plan Completion Gate

**REQUIRED: Pre-gate verification checklist.** Before resolving
the `completion_signoff` gate, verify ALL of the following:

1. All background agents have completed or reported results —
   check `TaskList` for any tasks still `in_progress`
2. No unaddressed review comments exist on the PR — check via
   `gh pr view --json reviewDecision,reviews`
3. CI checks have completed (not still running) — check via
   `gh pr checks`
4. Working copy is clean — `git status` shows no uncommitted
   changes
5. No pending fixup commits that haven't been pushed — compare
   local HEAD with remote tracking branch
6. **verify-acc-dod was invoked** — check the conversation for
   a `Skill(Dev10x:verify-acc-dod)` call. If absent, invoke it
   NOW before presenting the gate. This is the #1 bypass pattern
   (GH-471, GH-497, GH-930) — agents perform inline checks
   instead of delegating. Session `da0d9c73` repeated this —
   marking the task completed with an inline description and
   never firing the completion gate AskUserQuestion. The
   completion gate MUST NOT fire without it.

If any check fails, resolve it before presenting the gate.
Do NOT present "Work complete" as recommended when preconditions
are unmet.

**Recommendation defers to verify-acc-dod (GH-736).** The completion
gate recommendation is computed from the verify-acc-dod result, never
overridden by gate framing. While **any** blocking DoD check is
failing/pending —
`dev10x.domain.session_rules.completion_gate_recommendation()` returns
`GO_BACK` — you MUST NOT label, present, or auto-select "Work complete"
as Recommended. "The requested fix is done" is not "the PR is
merge-ready": a still-red check (e.g. open review threads) makes
**Go back** the only recommended option until the check is resolved or
the failing criterion is honestly removed from scope (see below).

**Scope-deferred review threads (GH-736).** When the supervisor has
explicitly deferred open PR review threads for this session (e.g.
"land the CI fix only, leave the review comments for a follow-up"),
the **"No unresolved review threads"** DoD check will stay red. Do NOT
paper over it by recommending "Work complete" anyway. Instead, make
the scope decision explicit so the DoD reflects it:

1. Detect the defer — a supervisor message scoping the session away
   from review-thread resolution ("defer the threads", "skip the
   review comments", "just the CI fix", "leave the open threads").
2. **Do NOT write `.claude/Dev10x/session.yaml`** (ADR-0018, ADR-0019).
   Whether the supervisor reads PRs here is a **durable project fact**,
   not a session flag: it lives as `supervisor_review: required|none` in
   the matching `projects[]` entry of the global
   `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml` (ADR-0022 D-2; the deprecated
   `human_review: true|false` spelling is still read for one release).
   Resolve the current value via
   `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__supervisor_review_status()` (default
   `required`) — never by reading the durable file directly — and branch:
   - **`supervisor_review: none`** — the project already says no
     supervisor pass is needed. `Dev10x:verify-acc-dod` skips the
     unresolved-threads and review-requested checks on its own; nothing
     to set. Note it in the next status line and go to step 3.
   - **`supervisor_review: required`** — the project says humans review, so the
     open thread is genuinely in scope. The check STAYS RED. **REQUIRED:
     Call `AskUserQuestion`** at every friction level (this is
     `ALWAYS_ASK` — flipping a project's review posture is not an
     auto-advance decision): "Open review threads remain and this
     project is configured for human review. How should the DoD treat
     them?" with options "Resolve threads now (Recommended)", "Change
     the project posture — set `human_review: false` in
     `~/.config/Dev10x/friction.yaml`", and "Hand over with the check
     red — record the open threads in Verify-AC".
3. Re-run the verify-acc-dod gate. When the checks are out of scope
   (`human_review: false`), a green run resolves honestly to **Work
   complete** / **Monitor for review** per the table below —
   `verify-acc-dod` reports them as "skipped (human_review: false)",
   *removed from scope* rather than silently passed.

If the project is configured for human review and the supervisor has not
changed that posture, an open thread is a failing blocking check →
**Go back**; never "Work complete".

**Why there is no per-session deferral (ADR-0019).** The old flow wrote
`review-deferred` to a file ADR-0018 retired, which the reader reached
only in an unconfigured repo — so in any configured repo the deferral
was written and never read, and the checks it was meant to skip ran
anyway. The replacement is durable and project-wide because the
underlying question is: *are humans (including this supervisor) involved
in review on this project?* The `review-deferred` mode string is still
**read** for back-compat, but nothing writes it.

**Merge-gated completion (GH-729).** Completion is reserved for the
**merged** state — "shippable / handed off to review" is NOT
terminal. Resolve the PR merge state (via
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__pr_detect` / `verify_pr_state`) and apply
`dev10x.domain.session_rules.completion_gate_recommendation()`:

- **Merged / no PR**, checks green → recommend **"Work complete"**.
- **Open, awaiting review** (CI green, comments addressed) →
  recommend **"Monitor PR for review"**: dispatch
  `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor)` to background-watch the PR (~5 min)
  and keep the session open. Under `solo-maintainer` the monitor →
  auto-merge path already runs (see § Solo-Maintainer Post-Create
  Monitor Mandate); the gate simply must not auto-select "Work
  complete" before the merge lands. The residual terminal task is
  **"Monitor PR #<N> for review / merge"**, not a passive
  "Verify AC and close".
- **CI failing / comments unaddressed** → resolve first (Go back).

Never offer or auto-select "Work complete" while an associated PR
is open/unmerged.

**Background agent task status:** Tasks for background agents
(e.g., PR monitor dispatched via `run_in_background`) MUST remain
`in_progress` until the agent confirms completion. Do NOT mark
them `completed` on dispatch — only mark `completed` when the
agent's result notification arrives and confirms success.

**After all checks pass** (including the non-waivable
`Skill(Dev10x:verify-acc-dod)` run from the pre-gate checklist
above — that delegation ALWAYS runs first, regardless of the
gate's resolved effect below):

Resolve whether the completion gate fires. Call
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="completion_signoff")`
and branch on `effect`. The recommended-option content itself
(which of the two questions below, and which option is
`(Recommended)`) still comes from
`completion_gate_recommendation()` per the GH-736/GH-729 rules
above — the resolver only decides whether confirmation is
required.

1. `effect == "ask"` — **REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT
   use plain text). Show the full task list via `TaskList`, then
   call:
   - **When the PR is merged (or the work is PR-less):**
     `AskUserQuestion(questions=[{question: "All tasks completed. How would you like to proceed?", header: "Done", options: [{label: "Work complete — hand over (Recommended)", description: "PR merged (or PR-less), all checks pass — ready to close"}, {label: "Add more tasks", description: "Continue with additional work"}, {label: "Revisit a step", description: "Re-examine a completed task"}], multiSelect: false}])`
   - **When an associated PR is open/unmerged but otherwise green
     (GH-729):**
     `AskUserQuestion(questions=[{question: "All checks pass and PR #<N> is awaiting review. How would you like to proceed?", header: "Done", options: [{label: "Monitor PR for review (Recommended)", description: "Keep the session open; background-watch PR #<N> every ~5 min via Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor and surface review/ready-to-merge"}, {label: "Add more tasks", description: "Continue with additional work"}, {label: "Override — complete anyway", description: "Accept the unmerged PR as done"}], multiSelect: false}])`
   - **When the PR is open/green under solo-maintainer + adaptive
     (GH-883) — `completion_gate_recommendation()` returns
     `AUTO_MERGE`:** there is no external reviewer to wait for and the
     adaptive contract forbids a manual checkpoint, so the terminal
     action is to auto-advance directly to `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-merge)`
     (its solo-maintainer config supplies the approval override) — NOT
     "monitor for review". Under `adaptive` the `completion_signoff`
     gate resolves to `auto-advance` (no widget). If it nonetheless
     resolves to `ask`, present the merged/PR-less question with "Merge
     now (Recommended)" as the lead option. Repo `allowed_overlays`
     policy still drops the solo-maintainer overlay before this ever
     resolves (`ModeGuardRule`), so a team repo (e.g. this one) never
     reaches AUTO_MERGE — it falls through to `MONITOR_REVIEW`.
2. `effect == "auto-advance"` — auto-select the recommended option
   from the applicable question above without prompting. Surface
   the returned `record` line in the transcript so a present
   supervisor can veto. Safety floors (e.g., an unmerged/CI-red PR)
   make the resolver return `ask` regardless of preset — this
   branch only fires when the resolver itself judged the work
   genuinely done.
3. `effect == "skip"` — skip the gate entirely, no prompt, no
   auto-complete announcement. Still never mark the terminal
   Verify-AC task completed autonomously (`essentials.md` Task
   List Invariant).
4. Response has an `error` key — fail safe: treat as `ask` and fire
   the applicable widget in step 1.

Never auto-complete the plan without the gate resolving to
`auto-advance` or `skip`, and never skip the mandatory
`Dev10x:verify-acc-dod` delegation above regardless of `effect`.
Plain text questions (e.g., "Ready to merge?") are NOT
acceptable in the `ask` branch — they allow the session to
auto-proceed without structured confirmation.

### Executing Detailed Tasks

Run the task directly. If the task has a `prompt` in metadata,
use it as execution guidance. If the task has `skills` in
metadata, delegate to those skills in order.

**REQUIRED: When the playbook step lists `skills:`, you MUST
invoke via `Skill()`. Do NOT perform actions directly.** Skill
delegation ensures consistent behavior, proper tool declarations,
and reusable orchestration. Bypassing delegation by inlining the
skill's logic breaks these guarantees.

**Unattended mode compliance — no checkpoints, but no shortcuts
either:** Auto-advance pressure in unattended mode makes it
tempting to perform operations directly (e.g., `git checkout -b`
instead of `Dev10x:ticket-branch`, inline review instead of
`Dev10x:review`). This is still a violation — "no checkpoints"
eliminates implicit pauses between steps;
it does NOT license raw-CLI substitutions for skill wrappers.
Unattended mode changes the *pace*, not the *rules*. If you catch
yourself about to skip a `Skill()` call, stop and invoke the
skill. Refer to the **Skill Routing Enforcement** table above —
it lists every action that MUST use a skill wrapper regardless of
execution mode. The two rules compose: auto-advance between steps,
but always through the correct skill.

**Mandatory delegation flag:** When a playbook step has
`skills:` entries, delegation is mandatory — not advisory.
The `skills:` field means "invoke these via `Skill()`", not
"consider using these". Zero of 15 expected delegations in
session 05d49f11 were made because the enforcement was
treated as optional. It is not optional.

**Mode `prompt:` overrides preserve `skills:` delegation
(GH-45):** A mode block (e.g., `solo-maintainer:`) that
overrides a step's `subject:` or `prompt:` does NOT remove the
step's `skills:` field. The skill delegation still applies —
the override changes only the documented behavior the skill
should adopt. The agent MUST invoke `Skill()` and let the skill
read the active mode from the durable prefs and apply the override
internally. Taking the prompt override literally and running
the raw command directly bypasses the skill's setup, validation,
and side effects.

**Anti-pattern (GH-45):** Step subject "Mark PR ready for
review" with `skills: [Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review]` and
`solo-maintainer` mode override `prompt: "Run gh pr ready. No
reviewers, no Slack."` Agent reads the prompt, runs `gh pr
ready 37` directly, never invokes the skill. Correct behavior:
invoke `Skill(Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review)`; the skill resolves
the `request_review` gate and takes the no-reviewer path itself.

Common skill delegations:

| Task | Delegated to |
|------|-------------|
| Set up workspace (branch) | `Dev10x:ticket-branch` skill |
| Set up workspace (worktree) | `Dev10x:git-worktree` skill |
| Draft Job Story | `Dev10x:jtbd` skill (attended mode) |
| Update ticket status | Linear MCP (see references/team-info.md) |
| Fetch PR context | `gh pr view` + `gh pr diff` |
| Code review | `Dev10x:review` (`--unattended`) + `Dev10x:review-fix` skills |
| Commit changes | `Dev10x:git-commit` skill |
| Create draft PR | `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` skill (`--unattended`) |
| Monitor CI | `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` skill |
| Apply fixups to review | `Dev10x:gh-pr-respond` skill |
| Groom commit history | `Dev10x:git-groom` skill |
| Update PR description | `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` skill (update mode) |
| Request review | `Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review` skill |
| Merge PR | `Dev10x:gh-pr-merge` skill |

### Post-Step Skill Delegation Verification

**REQUIRED: After completing ANY playbook step that lists
`skills:`, verify the delegation occurred.** Before marking
the task `completed`, confirm:

1. The `Skill()` tool was called for each listed skill
2. Raw CLI commands were NOT used as substitutes (e.g.,
   `git commit` instead of `Skill(Dev10x:git-commit)`)
3. If you used raw commands instead of `Skill()`, STOP —
   re-do the step with proper delegation before proceeding

This check exists because under auto-advance pressure, the
agent rationalizes raw commands as "equivalent" to skill
invocations. They are not — skills enforce gitmoji, JTBD,
Fixes links, CI monitoring, and other guardrails that raw
commands skip.

**Special attention: verify-acc-dod delegation.** The
acceptance criteria step is the most commonly bypassed
delegation (GH-471, GH-930). Agents perform inline AC checks
(e.g., "CI green, PR merged, looks good") instead of
invoking `Skill(Dev10x:verify-acc-dod)`. The inline check
skips structured PR state verification (`gh pr checks`,
`gh pr view --json isDraft`) and the skill's own
`AskUserQuestion` gate. Always delegate — unless a playbook
override provides an explicit inline substitute.

After verification, mark the task `completed` via
`TaskUpdate` and move to the next task.

### Task Reconciliation After Skill Delegation

**REQUIRED:** After a delegated skill completes (e.g.,
`Dev10x:gh-pr-respond`, `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor`), reconcile
the task list before proceeding. Delegated skills may create
their own tasks that overlap with the parent's remaining
pipeline steps. Without reconciliation, parent tasks remain
`pending` forever and the completion gate is never reached.

**Reconciliation protocol:**

1. Call `TaskList` after the delegated skill returns
2. Check if the delegated skill fulfilled any of the parent's
   remaining tasks (e.g., if `gh-pr-respond` ran groom + push,
   mark the parent's "Groom commit history" and "Push" tasks
   as `completed`)
3. Mark any tasks completed by the delegated skill's side
   effects — match by subject/action, not by task ID
4. If context compaction cleared the task list, recreate only
   the remaining uncompleted tasks from the playbook

This prevents the failure mode where delegated skills run
their own shipping pipeline, the parent's tasks are never
updated, and the completion gate never fires.

### Expanding Epic Tasks

When reaching an epic task:

1. **Read the step prompt** — if the task metadata contains a
   `prompt` field (from playbook.yaml), use it as guidance
   for how to execute or expand the step. The prompt may
   contain heuristics for adapting the step to context.
2. **Check for pre-templated children** — if the task metadata
   contains `steps` (from the playbook.yaml template), use
   those as the sub-task list instead of generating from scratch.
   Each child step may also have its own `prompt` for guidance.
   This gives users control over epic expansion via YAML.
3. **If no pre-templated children**, generate sub-tasks from
   context. This may involve:
   - Reading code to understand scope
   - `AskUserQuestion` for A/B decisions (e.g., "approach X
     vs approach Y?") — but only when the choice genuinely
     cannot be inferred from context
   - Follow-up information gathering
4. **Delegate to listed skills** — if the task or sub-task has
   `skills` in metadata, invoke those skills in order. Multiple
   skills on one step run sequentially (each may depend on the
   previous).
5. **Present sub-tasks** briefly (inline, not a new approval
   gate) and begin executing immediately. Only ask for
   approval if the expansion reveals unexpected scope or
   trade-offs the supervisor should weigh in on.
6. **Check for parallelism** — if sub-tasks are independent,
   ask the supervisor before launching parallel agents
7. **Execute sub-tasks**, marking each completed as they finish.
   Auto-advance between sub-tasks (same rule as top-level).
8. **Mark the epic completed** when all sub-tasks are done

### Multi-Issue Execution

When multiple issues are provided, two strategies exist:

**Strategy A: Separate PRs (fanout — default)**

Each issue gets its own branch, PR, and full playbook play.
Use `Dev10x:fanout` for parallel execution or sequential
execution within `work-on`.

Each issue MUST execute the **full playbook play** — not a
collapsed subset. Fanout does NOT exempt individual issues
from the shipping pipeline.

**Strategy B: Bundled PR (atomic commits)**

All issues share one branch and one PR. Each issue becomes
one atomic commit. The shipping pipeline runs once for the
bundle, not per issue. Use this when issues are small,
related, and benefit from a single review cycle.

**Bundled execution pattern:**
```
1. Set up workspace (one branch for all issues), branched
   from a freshly-fetched origin/<base>
2. Batch the issues (see § Batch Detection below)
3. For each BATCH (sequentially):
   a. Re-sync onto fresh base (see § Per-Batch Base Re-Sync
      below) — pre-review hygiene only; SKIPPED once review
      fixups / unresolved threads exist
   b. Design approach for this batch
   c. Implement changes
   d. Create atomic commit (one per batch; ticket IDs of
      every batch member appear in the commit body)
4. Verify (run tests once for all changes)
5. Shipping pipeline (review → PR → CI → groom → merge)
```

#### Per-Batch Base Re-Sync (GH-626)

In an actively-developed area the base branch advances while the
bundle is being worked, so later batches — and the shipping
pipeline — hit merge conflicts and **superseded-duplicate** work
that only surface at `Monitor CI` / merge time. Re-syncing each
batch onto the fresh base *before* working it converts those
late, expensive conflict cycles into cheap up-front detection.

Before step 3b (Design) of each batch:

1. Resolve `<base>` via `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_base_branch`
   (develop → main fallback). Always rebase onto `origin/<base>`,
   never the possibly-stale local ref (same caution
   `Dev10x:git-groom` documents in Phase 1, GH-486).
2. Fetch `origin/<base>` and rebase the bundle branch onto it via
   `Skill(Dev10x:git-groom)` / the existing rebase wrapper —
   never raw `git rebase`.
3. After any force-push from this pre-review rebase, re-monitor
   CI (already required — see § CI Re-Monitoring After Force Push).

**Critical constraint — never rebase once review fixups exist.**
The auto re-sync applies **only before reviews start**. Once
fixup commits are addressing in-progress review threads, a rebase
rewrites the base SHAs that review-thread permalinks reference
(`/pull/N/commits/<sha>` → 404) and destroys the per-comment
audit trail. This is the same invariant `Dev10x:git-groom`
enforces in **Phase 0 (refuse pre-merge groom with open
unresolved threads, GH-68 Fix E)** — the two rules compose:

- **Suppress** the re-sync when any unresolved review thread or
  review fixup exists on the PR.
- Fixup commits stay on their original base; only true merge
  conflicts at that point are resolved in place (resolve-in-rebase
  or a base-merge that does not rewrite the fixup SHAs), never a
  wholesale rebase that orphans permalinks.

In short: **re-sync-onto-fresh-base is a per-batch pre-work /
pre-review hygiene step; it is forbidden once a review cycle has
begun.**

The "Implement changes" epic expands to one sub-task per
**batch** — not per individual issue. Each sub-task produces
exactly one commit. When a batch has a single member, the
commit references that one ticket; when a batch covers
multiple overlapping tickets, the commit body lists every
ticket ID and `Fixes:` line. The shipping pipeline runs
once — the PR references all bundled issues via multiple
`Fixes:` lines aggregated across batches.

#### Batch Detection (GH-196)

Bundled execution allows two layouts: **sequential** (one
commit per ticket) and **batched** (one commit per group of
overlapping tickets). Default to the sequential layout. Promote
tickets into a shared batch only when overlap signals justify
it; arbitrary grouping muddies review.

**Overlap signals** (gathered from Phase 2 context):

1. **Shared component** — Sentry issues report failures in the
   same file/module/class, or ticket bodies name the same path
2. **Shared error class** — Sentry traces show the same
   exception type from the same code path
3. **Same parent ticket** — Linear tickets share a parent, or
   GitHub issues link to the same tracking issue
4. **Repeated label set** — every ticket carries the same
   non-milestone label (e.g., `audit:patterns`, `flaky-test`)
5. **Explicit reference** — one ticket body mentions another
   by ID with intent to fix together

Two tickets share a batch when **at least 2** of the signals
above hold simultaneously. Tickets without overlap signals
form singleton batches. Never put more than 5 tickets in a
single batch — review readability degrades past that point.

**Shared-file tickets always collapse into one batch (GH-591).**
When two bundle members edit the **same file**, they CANNOT become
separate per-issue commits: splitting them would require hunk-level
selective staging, which `Dev10x:git-commit` explicitly prohibits
("NEVER stage individual files by name"). A shared file is a strong
form of the **shared component** signal — treat it as decisive on
its own and place the members in one batch even if no second signal
holds. The batched-layout convention then applies: one atomic
commit whose body lists every member with a `Fixes:` line per
ticket (see the per-batch commit-message convention below). Do NOT
attempt per-issue commits for shared-file members.

**Surfacing the batch plan:**

After detection, resolve the batch-layout gate. Compute
`overlap_signals` as the signal count of the **least-confident**
proposed non-singleton batch (when every proposed batch is a
singleton, pass `context={}` — there is no non-singleton batch to
score). Call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="batch_layout",
context={"overlap_signals": <N>})` and branch on `effect`:

1. `effect == "ask"` — present the proposed batch layout. Each
   option below is REQUIRED — do not collapse to plain-text
   confirmation:
   `AskUserQuestion(questions=[{question: "Proposed batch layout for bundled execution:\n\n<batch_summary>\n\nHow would you like to proceed?", header: "Batches", options: [{label: "Accept (Recommended)", description: "Use the proposed batches; one commit per batch"}, {label: "Sequential (no batching)", description: "Treat every ticket as its own batch — one commit per ticket"}, {label: "Edit batches", description: "Describe regrouping (which tickets merge or split)"}], multiSelect: false}])`
2. `effect == "auto-advance"` — auto-select "Accept (Recommended)"
   without prompting. Surface the returned `record` line in the
   transcript so a present supervisor can veto.
3. `effect == "skip"` — skip the gate entirely; use the proposed
   batches as-is with no announcement.
4. Response has an `error` key — fail safe: treat as `ask` and fire
   the widget in step 1.

The `<batch_summary>` placeholder enumerates each proposed
batch, e.g.:

```
Batch 1: GH-12, GH-14
  Signals: shared component (payments/service.py),
           shared error class (SquareTimeoutError)
Batch 2: GH-21
  Signals: singleton — no overlap with others
```

A batch sitting at exactly 2 signals is the resolver's designed
`ask` boundary — ambiguous batches are the one case where bundling
needs explicit human sign-off; do not second-guess an `ask` effect
by auto-accepting anyway.

**Persisting the batch plan:** After approval, extend the
Phase 3 plan-sync context with the batch layout so it survives
compaction:

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__plan_sync_set_context(args=[
  "bundling=true",
  "batches=[[\"GH-12\",\"GH-14\"],[\"GH-21\"]]"
])
```

**Per-batch commit message convention:** Use the gitmoji of the
dominant change type, followed by the first ticket ID in the
batch as the canonical ticket reference. The commit body lists
every batch member with one `Fixes:` line per ticket. Example:

```
♻️ GH-12 Tighten Square timeout handling across payment paths

Bundle members:
- GH-12 Retry transient SquareTimeoutError on capture
- GH-14 Surface timeout reason in refund response

Fixes: GH-12
Fixes: GH-14
```

**Commit step positioning (GH-164):** The shipping-pipeline
`Commit outstanding changes` step (4.7 in the solo-maintainer
fragment) runs ONCE at the end of all bundle sub-tasks — for
any residual changes from review/simplify, not as the
per-issue commit driver. The per-issue commits happen
*inside* the "Implement changes" epic (step 2c above), not in
the shipping pipeline. Audit GH-164 caught an agent that
treated the shipping-pipeline commit step as a sibling of
the implementation sub-tasks and committed after the very
first sub-task — prematurely, before later bundle members
were implemented.

Rule: in bundle mode, every per-issue commit is a child of
"Implement changes". The shipping-pipeline `Commit outstanding
changes` step must be positioned strictly AFTER all
implementation children complete.

**Pre-review commit step (GH-858 F3):** The shipping pipeline now
opens with a `Commit implementation changes` step *before* `Code
review`. `Dev10x:review` diffs commits against base (`develop-diff`),
not the working tree, so a single-ticket branch whose implementation
is still uncommitted would review an empty diff. The new step commits
that work first. In bundle mode this is a no-op — the per-issue
commits already happened inside "Implement changes" — so the two
commit steps do not conflict: the pre-review step catches the
non-bundle case, and the trailing `Commit outstanding changes` step
still sweeps residual review/simplify changes.

**Strategy selection:** Compute the **recommended** strategy —
Strategy B when the user explicitly requests bundling (e.g.,
"one PR", "atomic commits", "bundle these"), Strategy B when the
**Same-Milestone Heuristic (GH-948)** below holds, otherwise
Strategy A (fanout). The strategy-choice gate (`strategy_choice`)
decides whether that recommendation needs confirmation — see below.

**Same-Milestone Heuristic (GH-948):** Prefer Strategy B
(bundled) when ALL of these conditions hold:

1. **Same milestone** — every classified ticket belongs to
   the same GitHub milestone (or Linear project). Detect via
   the `milestone` field from `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_get`
   or the Linear project field. Skip this check if any ticket
   lacks a milestone field.
2. **No separate reviewer** — `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(
   gate="request_review", context={})` returns `effect: "skip"`.
   Team reviewers imply separate review cycles, so fanout
   remains correct whenever that gate asks or auto-advances.
3. **Small/medium effort** — no ticket is labeled `effort:L`,
   `effort:XL`, or `size:L`+. Large epics warrant isolation
   even within a milestone.
4. **Thematically related** — tickets share at least one
   non-milestone label (e.g., all `audit:patterns`, all
   `refactor:cleanup`).

When all four conditions hold, the recommended strategy is
Strategy B; when any condition fails, it falls back to Strategy A
(fanout). The heuristic only changes the **recommended** strategy
— it does not decide whether the gate fires.

**Resolving the strategy-choice gate.** Call
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="strategy_choice")` and
branch on `effect`:

1. `effect == "ask"` — present both strategies via `AskUserQuestion`
   with the recommended one marked `(Recommended)`:
   `AskUserQuestion(questions=[{question: "Multiple issues detected. How should they be executed?", header: "Strategy", options: [{label: "Separate PRs (fanout)<Recommended marker on the winning option>", description: "Each issue gets its own branch, PR, and full playbook play"}, {label: "Bundled PR (atomic commits)<Recommended marker on the winning option>", description: "All issues share one branch/PR; each issue becomes one atomic commit"}], multiSelect: false}])`
2. `effect == "auto-advance"` — use the recommended strategy without
   prompting. Surface the returned `record` line in the transcript
   so a present supervisor can veto.
3. `effect == "skip"` — use the recommended strategy with no
   announcement.
4. Response has an `error` key — fail safe: treat as `ask` and fire
   the widget in step 1.

**Anti-pattern (PROHIBITED for both strategies):**
```
for each issue:
  branch → edit → commit → push → PR   # 5 steps
```

### Parallelism Policy

| Phase | Parallelism | Approval needed? |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Phase 2 (Gather) | Auto-parallel | No |
| Phase 4 (detailed tasks) | Sequential | No |
| Phase 4 (epic sub-tasks) | Parallel if independent | Yes — ask supervisor |

When asking about parallelism, present which tasks would run
concurrently and why they're independent:

```
Tasks 4a and 4b are independent (different files, no shared state).
Run them in parallel?
- Yes, launch parallel agents (Recommended)
- No, run sequentially
```

**Subagent implementation model (GH-904 F3).** When Phase 4
sub-tasks are dispatched to parallel implementer agents:

- **Partition by disjoint file sets.** Each agent must own a
  distinct set of files so two agents never write the same
  working tree path — concurrent writes to a shared file are a
  clobber, not a merge.
- **Dependency spine + one parallel wave.** Model the work as a
  sequential spine of tasks with real dependencies, plus at most
  one wave of independent chunks dispatched in parallel off that
  spine. Do not chain multiple parallel waves — the spine already
  captures the ordering constraints.
- **Never run a shared-DB test suite concurrently.** Parallel
  implementers MUST NOT each run the full test suite against a
  shared database at the same time — defer to a single serialized
  test run after all chunks land, to avoid cross-agent state
  interference.
- **Import dependencies usually force a mostly-sequential spine.**
  Most feature work has one module depending on another, so the
  parallel wave is typically small — expect modest, not dramatic,
  wall-clock gains from parallelism.

**Worktree isolation limitation:** Agents dispatched with
`isolation: "worktree"` cannot use the `Write` tool — Claude Code
restricts Write access to the main session's working directory.
Use `Bash(cat <<'EOF' > file)` or `Edit` as a workaround inside
worktree-isolated agents. Alternatively, avoid `isolation: "worktree"`
and use sequential tool calls in the main session instead.

**`bypassPermissions` limitation:** The `bypassPermissions` flag
does not propagate into worktree isolation contexts. If a task
step requires unattended execution inside a worktree agent, use
`mode: "dontAsk"` on the Agent call or avoid `isolation: "worktree"`
for that step. Sequential tool calls in the main session are the
safest fallback for permission-sensitive operations.

### Skill Delegation During Execution

**Workspace setup** (uses the decision from Phase 1):

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Main repo, user wants worktree | Invoke `Dev10x:git-worktree` (creates branch internally — do NOT call `Dev10x:ticket-branch` first) |
| Main repo, work here | Invoke `Dev10x:ticket-branch` to create feature branch |
| Worktree, generic WT branch | Invoke `Dev10x:ticket-branch` to create work-specific branch from within the worktree |
| Worktree, matching feature branch | No action needed — branch already exists |

If the Phase 1 workspace decision was deferred (local-only
work), resolve the workspace-choice gate. Call
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__resolve_gate(gate="workspace_choice")` and
branch on `effect`:

1. `effect == "ask"` — **REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT
   use plain text, call spec:
   [ask-workspace-decision.md](./tool-calls/ask-workspace-decision.md)).
   Options:
   - Work here (Recommended) — Use current directory and branch
   - New worktree — Create an isolated worktree
2. `effect == "auto-advance"` — use the recommended option ("Work
   here") without prompting. Surface the returned `record` line in
   the transcript so a present supervisor can veto.
3. `effect == "skip"` — use the recommended option with no
   announcement.
4. Response has an `error` key — fail safe: treat as `ask` and fire
   the widget in step 1.

**Job Story drafting:**
- MUST invoke `Skill(Dev10x:jtbd)` explicitly — never draft inline
- Pass gathered context to avoid redundant API calls
- If approved, write back to the ticket:

| Tracker | Write-back |
|---------|-----------|
| GitHub | `gh issue comment` |
| Linear | Prepend to description via `save_issue` |
| JIRA | `Dev10x:jira` skill |

**Ticket status update (Linear only):**

**REQUIRED after workspace setup:** When a ticket-backed plan
starts execution (feature or bugfix), update the ticket status
to "In Progress" immediately after the "Set up workspace" step
completes. Do NOT defer this to the end of the session.

1. Get statuses: `list_issue_statuses(teamId)` from
   references/team-info.md
2. Find "In Progress" (type `started`)
3. Update: `save_issue(id, stateId)`
4. Skip if already "In Progress"; warn if "Done"/"Canceled"

---

## Pause/Resume

At any pause signal ("wrap up", "pause", "that's enough for
today", end-of-session):

1. Invoke `Dev10x:session-wrap-up` — it reads `TaskList` and
   discovers all open tasks automatically
2. `Dev10x:session-wrap-up` handles routing each open item (PR
   bookmark, TODO.md, Slack DM, etc.)
3. The task list itself serves as resume context — when the user
   resumes work, they can invoke `Dev10x:park-discover` to find
   deferred items and `Dev10x:session-tasks` to see the saved
   task list

No custom bookmarking needed — leverage existing
`Dev10x:session-wrap-up` and `Dev10x:park` infrastructure.

---

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT use `ExitPlanMode` or Claude Code's built-in plan mode.**
  This skill has its own planning phase (Phase 3) that uses
  `TaskCreate` + `AskUserQuestion`. Writing a plan file and calling
  `ExitPlanMode` bypasses the playbook system and destroys the
  session's task-tracking capability. If the user asks to "see the
  plan" or "prepare a draft", present it via `AskUserQuestion` at
  the Phase 3 approval gate — never via plan mode.
- **Always create tasks via `TaskCreate`** — never skip the task
  list, even for single-step work. The supervisor uses it to add
  new tasks mid-session.
- Always verify ticket exists before creating a branch
- If ticket is "Done"/"Canceled" (Linear) or "closed" (GitHub),
  warn the user before proceeding
- Handle errors gracefully — if a fetch fails, continue with
  what was gathered and note the failure in the context summary
- Linear team UUID is in `references/team-info.md` (template)
- After completing work, use `Dev10x:gh-pr-create` to create the PR
- Do not modify ticket description or add comments unless the
  user explicitly approves (e.g., Job Story write-back)
- **Batch data files must use `.json` format** — never `.env`.
  Pre-tool-use hooks block `.env` file creation. When creating
  temporary data files (e.g., batch issue lists, config), use
  `.json` instead.

### Known Limitations

- **Worktree cleanup:** No skill currently handles worktree
  teardown after work completes. Users must manually run
  `git worktree remove <path>` when done.
- **PR merge-to-completion lifecycle:** The `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor`
  skill stops after CI passes and review is requested — it does
  not monitor through to merge. Users must manually merge or
  re-invoke monitoring after approval.
- **Write tool in worktree agents:** See Parallelism Policy
  section for the `isolation: "worktree"` Write tool limitation.
- **`bypassPermissions` in worktree agents:** See Parallelism
  Policy section for the propagation limitation and workarounds.

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Ticket URL

**User:** `/Dev10x:work-on https://github.com/org/repo/issues/15`

**Phase 1:** Classify → `github-issue`, repo=`org/repo`, number=15

**Phase 2:** Fetch issue. Body mentions Sentry URL → fetch Sentry
issue. Body mentions PR #42 → fetch PR. Produce context summary.

**Phase 3:** Load `feature` plan template (user overrides →
defaults → schema). Build subtasks of Phase 4:
```
4.1  [detailed] Set up workspace          → Dev10x:ticket-branch
4.2  [detailed] Draft Job Story           → Dev10x:jtbd
4.3  [epic]     Design implementation approach (3 children)
4.4  [detailed] Plan the commit sequence
4.5  [epic]     Implement changes
4.6  [epic]     Verify (2 children)
4.7  [detailed] Code review               → Dev10x:review + Dev10x:review-fix
4.8  [detailed] Commit outstanding changes → Dev10x:git-commit
4.9  [detailed] Create draft PR           → Dev10x:gh-pr-create

4.14 [detailed] Request review            → Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review
4.15 [detailed] Verify acceptance criteria
```
Supervisor approves.

**Phase 4:** Auto-advance through subtasks 4.1-4.15, expanding
epics as reached. No pauses between tasks unless a genuine
decision is needed.

### Example 2: Multiple Inputs

**User:** `/Dev10x:work-on TEAM-133 https://slack.com/archives/C123/p456 "check the retry logic"`

**Phase 1:** Classify →
- `linear-ticket` TEAM-133
- `slack-thread` C123/p456
- `note` "check the retry logic"

**Phase 2:** Fetch all three in parallel. Linear ticket links to
Sentry issue → fetch that too. Produce context summary with 4
sources.

**Phase 3:** Load `bugfix` plan template (Sentry issue detected):

```
4.1  [detailed] Set up workspace          → Dev10x:ticket-branch
4.2  [detailed] Reproduce the issue
4.3  [epic]     Investigate root cause (2 children)
4.4  [epic]     Implement fix
4.5  [epic]     Verify fix (2 children)
4.6  [detailed] Code review               → Dev10x:review + Dev10x:review-fix
4.7  [detailed] Commit outstanding changes → Dev10x:git-commit
4.8  [detailed] Create draft PR           → Dev10x:gh-pr-create
4.9  [detailed] Monitor CI                → Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor
4.10 [epic]     Apply fixups              → Dev10x:gh-pr-respond
4.11 [detailed] Groom commit history      → Dev10x:git-groom
4.12 [detailed] Update PR description     → Dev10x:gh-pr-create
4.13 [detailed] Request review            → Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review
4.14 [detailed] Verify acceptance criteria
```

### Example 3: PR Continuation

**User:** `/Dev10x:work-on https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42`

**Phase 1:** Classify → `github-pr`, number=42

**Phase 2:** Fetch PR. Body has `Fixes: GH-15` → fetch issue.
PR has 3 review comments → note them.

**Phase 3:** Load `pr-continuation` plan template:
```
4.1  [detailed] Fetch PR and review context
4.2  [epic]     Address review comments
4.3  [epic]     Apply fixups              → Dev10x:gh-pr-respond
4.4  [detailed] Code review               → Dev10x:review + Dev10x:review-fix
4.5  [detailed] Commit outstanding changes → Dev10x:git-commit
4.6  [detailed] Monitor CI                → Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor
4.7  [detailed] Groom commit history      → Dev10x:git-groom
4.8  [detailed] Update PR description     → Dev10x:gh-pr-create
4.9  [detailed] Request re-review         → Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review
4.10 [detailed] Verify acceptance criteria
```

### Example 4: Mid-Workflow Pause

User is at task 4 of 7 and says "let's wrap up for today".

1. Skill detects pause signal
2. Invokes `Dev10x:session-wrap-up`
3. `Dev10x:session-wrap-up` reads `TaskList` — sees 3 pending tasks
4. Routes each via `Dev10x:park` (e.g., PR bookmark, TODO.md)
5. Session ends with bookmark saved

Next session: user runs `Dev10x:discover` to find bookmarks and
resume where they left off.

### Example 5: Bundled Execution with Batches (GH-196)

**User:** `/Dev10x:work-on GH-12 GH-14 GH-21`

**Phase 1:** Classify three `github-issue` sources.
`bundling_candidate = true` (3 ticket inputs).

**Phase 2:** Fetch all three in parallel.
- GH-12: "Retry transient SquareTimeoutError on capture"
  (label: `payments`, mentions `payments/service.py`)
- GH-14: "Surface timeout reason in refund response"
  (label: `payments`, mentions `payments/service.py`)
- GH-21: "Add metrics for retry attempts"
  (label: `observability`, mentions `metrics/`)

All three share the `audit:payments` milestone. GH-12 and GH-14
overlap on **shared component** (`payments/service.py`) AND
**shared label** (`payments`) — 2 signals → same batch. GH-21
has no overlap with either → singleton batch.

**Phase 3:** Same-Milestone Heuristic favors Strategy B
(bundled). Solo-maintainer mode is active.

Batch Detection proposes:
```
Batch 1: GH-12, GH-14
  Signals: shared component (payments/service.py),
           shared label (payments)
Batch 2: GH-21
  Signals: singleton — no overlap with others
```

`AskUserQuestion` Batches gate fires (Batch 1 has only 2
signals → not auto-accepted). User picks "Accept (Recommended)".

Persist plan context with `bundling=true` and
`batches=[["GH-12","GH-14"],["GH-21"]]`.

Plan template (feature play, bundle layout):
```
4.1  [detailed] Set up workspace
4.2  [epic]     Implement Batch 1 (GH-12 + GH-14)
       ├─ Read payments/service.py
       ├─ Apply both fixes
       └─ Atomic commit: "♻️ GH-12 Tighten Square timeout
           handling across payment paths" (Fixes: GH-12,
           GH-14)
4.3  [epic]     Implement Batch 2 (GH-21)
       ├─ Add retry metrics
       └─ Atomic commit: "✨ GH-21 Add retry-attempt metrics"
           (Fixes: GH-21)
4.4  [epic]     Verify (run tests once for all batches)
4.5+ [shipping pipeline — runs once for the whole bundle]
```

**Phase 4:** Each "Implement Batch" epic produces exactly one
commit. The shipping pipeline runs once and creates a PR whose
body lists all three `Fixes:` lines, so each issue auto-closes
on merge.
