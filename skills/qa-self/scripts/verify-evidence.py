"""Verify captured QA evidence before it is reviewed or uploaded.

A green capture run proves the code ran, not that the artifacts show
anything: a step guarded by a silent conditional no-ops, and the empty
screenshot or content-free video publishes anyway (GH-1086). This script
is the gate between capture and the local review — it fails loud on the
artifact shapes that a passing suite cannot distinguish from success.

Per screenshot:
  - a file-size floor (a blank or truncated PNG is tiny)
  - a non-uniform-frame check (a screenshot of one flat colour shows
    nothing, whatever its dimensions)

Per video:
  - the same size floor
  - frames extracted with ffmpeg at three points through the recording,
    each run through the same uniformity check
  - a border check for the grey padding Playwright leaves when the
    viewport is smaller than ``record_video_size`` (GH-1204)

Uniformity is measured with ImageMagick's ``identify`` (already required
by ``convert-evidence.sh``) as the image's standard deviation, normalised
to 0..1. Frame extraction uses ffmpeg, likewise already required.

Output: a JSON report on stdout. Exit 0 when every artifact passes, 1
when any fails, 2 on a usage or tooling error. Errors are emitted as
JSON on stdout too, so a caller parses exactly one channel (see
`.claude/rules/script-domain-boundaries.md`).
