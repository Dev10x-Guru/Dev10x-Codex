# Python Test Verifier

## Overview

Run the test suite and verify all tests pass with 100% coverage
for new code. Reports concise summaries — detailed output only on
failures.

## When to Use

- Code changes need test verification before committing
- Before creating a pull request
- Explicitly asked to run tests or check coverage
- After implementing fixes to verify they work

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run Tests

**Preferred — MCP tool** (works in every session, including
worktrees where `pytest` is not on PATH and the Bash hook blocks
every direct invocation form, GH-238):

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__run_tests()
```

Pass extra pytest args via the `args` parameter, e.g.
`args=["src/dev10x/runner/"]` or `args=["-k", "name"]`. The tool
returns a structured payload: `returncode`, `summary`, `passed`,
`failed`, `skipped`, `coverage_percent`, `failed_tests`,
`missing_coverage`, `extras`, `retried_with_extras`, `stdout`,
`stderr`. The subprocess is launched from the MCP server so the
PreToolUse hook does not apply.

**The tool resolves the project's dependency extra itself
(GH-1198).** It reads `[project.optional-dependencies]` from
`pyproject.toml` and adds the group that declares pytest, so a suite
whose test dependencies live under a `dev` extra runs green without
anyone typing `--extra dev`. `extras` reports what it applied. When
resolution finds nothing and the run dies at collection on a
`ModuleNotFoundError`, it retries once with `--extra dev` and sets
`retried_with_extras` — read that as a signal the project's extras
are named unusually, not as a normal outcome.

Before this, the sanctioned wrapper could not run such a suite at
all, so the agent fell back to the raw command the routing table
forbids — and kept using it for every iteration of the fix-test
loop. **If you find yourself reaching for a raw `pytest` because
the wrapper failed on a missing import — or timed out — that is a
bug in the wrapper: file it rather than working around it.**

**The default timeout is the transport ceiling (GH-1331).**
`run_tests()` defaults `timeout` to `MAX_TOOL_CALL_SECONDS` (1080s)
— the largest value the MCP transport is clamped to anyway
(GH-1288) — so omitting the parameter already asks for the most
the wrapper can serve. A run that still times out at that ceiling
means the full suite genuinely needs longer than one tool call can
give it: narrow with `args=["-k", "name"]` / a path, or split the
suite across calls. On timeout the payload carries `verdict`,
`elapsed`, `timeout_clamped`, and whatever `stdout`/`stderr` pytest
produced before the cut-off, so a slow-but-green run is
distinguishable from a hang.

**Fallback — Bash** (only when the MCP server is unavailable):

```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

Inside a worktree (`.git` is a file, not a directory), prefix
with `uv run`, and add the extra that carries the test
dependencies if the project declares one:

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Step 2: Parse Results

Extract:
- Total tests run
- Tests passed/failed
- Coverage percentage
- Uncovered lines (if any)

### Step 3: Report Summary

**If all tests pass:**
```
Tests: 150 passed
Coverage: 100%
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests: 148 passed, 2 failed

Failed tests:
1. test_calculate_total - AssertionError: expected 100, got 99
2. test_validate_input - ValueError: invalid input

Coverage: 98% (missing: src/service.py:45-48)
```

## Coverage Enforcement

If coverage is below 100% for files changed in the current branch,
the branch introduced the regression. Report the failure and fix
the gap — do not ask the user whether to proceed with coverage
below 100%.

## Important Notes

- Always run tests before committing
- Ensure 100% coverage for new code
- Fix failing tests before creating PR
- Use `-v` flag for verbose output when debugging
