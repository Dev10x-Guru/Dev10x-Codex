description: >
  Diagnose drift between user intent and observed agent behavior in
  Dev10x sessions. Runs pluggable strategies that each detect one
  drift category (MCP-vs-script confusion, missing dir coverage,
  stale memories, monorepo uv-run-project friction, missing local
  skill pre-approvals), explain the root cause, and propose a
  remediation patch — never auto-applied; always confirmed via
  AskUserQuestion.
  TRIGGER when: user hits repeated permission friction despite prior
  cleanup, notices the agent reaching for shell-script fallbacks
  instead of MCP tools, or wants a systemic audit of intent drift.
  DO NOT TRIGGER when: a single permission rule needs ad-hoc
  debugging (use Dev10x:permission-investigator) or the issue is a
  one-off skill bug (file a ticket instead).

# Dev10x:plugin-doctor — Intent Drift Diagnostic (GH-87)

Surfaces systemic drift across settings, memories, hook messages,
and skill docs that no single permission rule can fix. The skill
is composed of **strategies** — small detectors, each owning one
drift category. Strategies share a common interface so adding a
new one requires only a new file under
`src/dev10x/skills/doctor/strategies/`; the skill core does not
change.

## Why a separate skill

| Existing | Scope | Limitation |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `Dev10x:permission-investigator` | Rule shape mutation matrix | Doesn't read memories or doc drift |
| `Dev10x:plugin-maintenance` | Ensures permissions present | Doesn't diagnose why intent breaks |
| `Dev10x:memory-maintenance` | Memory consolidation | Doesn't link drift to permission friction |

`Dev10x:plugin-doctor` orchestrates these as remediation targets — it
diagnoses, then delegates concrete edits.

## Orchestration

**REQUIRED: Create tasks before ANY work.** Execute these
`TaskCreate` calls at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 1: Load enabled strategies", activeForm="Loading strategies")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 2: Detect drift per strategy", activeForm="Detecting drift")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 3: Present findings and remediations", activeForm="Presenting findings")`

## Step 0 — Check Dev10x config location (GH-215)

Before strategy detection, run `dev10x config doctor` to report
any legacy Dev10x config files still living under `~/.claude/`.
If files are found, offer to run `dev10x config migrate` (or
delegate to `Dev10x:upgrade-cleanup` which migrates as Step 1).

```
Bash("dev10x config doctor")
```

`dev10x config doctor` reports two independent axes: legacy file
*location* (GH-215) and durable-pref *schema version* (GH-1166).
Treat both a "Found N legacy ..." and a "Found N durable config
entr… on v1" line as findings to surface in Phase 3, alongside
the strategy detections. The remediation for the second is
`dev10x config migrate-schema` (preview it with `--dry-run`),
which converts v1 presets and `human_review` / `walk_away` to
`supervisor_review` + `gate_overlays` and can only add oversight,
never remove it.
4. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 4: Apply approved fixes", activeForm="Applying fixes")`

Set sequential dependencies. Mark each completed when done.

### Phase 1: Load strategies

The plugin ships a default strategy catalog under
`src/dev10x/skills/doctor/strategies/`. Each strategy module
exports a `Strategy` dataclass:

```python
@dataclass
class Strategy:
    id: str                                 # "mcp-vs-script-drift"
    description: str                        # one-line summary
    detect: Callable[[Context], list[Finding]]
    remediate: Callable[[Finding], Remediation]
```

`Context` carries paths to settings files, memory directories, and
hook log access — strategies read but do not mutate. The first
shipped strategy is :mod:`dev10x.skills.doctor.strategies.mcp_vs_script_drift`
(MCP tool vs shell fallback). See
[`references/strategy-catalog.md`](references/strategy-catalog.md)
for the planned strategy roster.

### Phase 2: Detect drift

Iterate enabled strategies. Each strategy:

1. Reads the relevant input (memory file, settings JSON, SKILL.md,
   audit log).
2. Returns a list of :class:`Finding` records with:
   - `strategy_id`
   - `severity` (`critical` / `drift` / `suggestion`)
   - `location` (file path + line, or memory slug)
   - `evidence` (the offending text, quoted)
   - `proposed_fix` (string description; the actual edit is in the
     `Remediation`)

### Phase 3: Present findings

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** for each finding (do NOT use
plain text). Options:

- **Apply (Recommended)** — execute the strategy's remediation
- **Skip** — leave as-is for this session
- **Defer** — file a ticket for follow-up via `issue_create`

Group findings by strategy in the presentation. For 5+ findings in
one strategy, offer "Apply all in this strategy" as a batch option.

### Phase 4: Apply approved fixes

Each remediation either:

- Edits a memory file in place (use `Edit`)
- Delegates to `Dev10x:plugin-maintenance` for settings changes
- Delegates to `Dev10x:memory-maintenance` for memory restructuring
- Files an upstream issue via `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_create`
  when the drift originates in the plugin itself

Never auto-apply across strategies — each Finding is its own gate.

## Initial Strategy: `mcp-vs-script-drift`

Detects memory entries, SKILL.md examples, and allow rules citing
shell-script paths when an MCP tool offers the same capability.
"Never use the script" memories load the literal forbidden path
into context every session, priming the agent to reach for it.
See [`references/mcp-vs-script-drift.md`](references/mcp-vs-script-drift.md)
for the equivalence table and detection heuristics.

## Non-Interactive Runner (GH-1321)

`dev10x doctor run` sweeps the same strategies with no agent in
the loop and prints a JSON verdict, so catalog health is
assertable from CI instead of waiting on someone to notice a
prompt. Exit 0 = clean, 1 = a finding reached `--threshold`
(default `drift`, excluding suggestions), 2 = the sweep failed.

A runner is a noise amplifier before it is a convenience, so it
does not ship alone. Two mechanisms keep it usable: severity
grading — the doctor's largest false-positive class is graded
`suggestion` and never gates anything — and a durable acceptance
catalog at `~/.config/Dev10x/doctor-accepted-findings.yaml`. An
acceptance **moves** a finding out of the blocking set; it never
hides one, and an entry matching nothing is reported as stale.
See [`references/non-interactive-runner.md`](references/non-interactive-runner.md)
for the catalog schema, the payload shape, and why a CI check is
not the periodic run this skill's anti-patterns forbid.

## Pluggability

Adding a new strategy:

1. Drop a module under `src/dev10x/skills/doctor/strategies/`
2. Export `Strategy` per the interface above
3. Add the module path to `strategies.yaml`

No skill-core changes required. User strategies under
`~/.claude/Dev10x/doctor/strategies/` are loaded after defaults.

## Anti-patterns

- **Auto-applying remediations** — every fix passes through
  `AskUserQuestion`. Drift detection is high-signal but
  remediation context is user-specific.
- **Quoting the offending path in fix output** — memories with
  negative examples (`"never use X"`) reinforce the wrong pattern.
  Strategies rephrase fixes to avoid literal forbidden tokens.
- **Running periodically** — the doctor is on-demand. A periodic
  run would re-prompt for findings the user already chose to skip.
  `dev10x doctor run` is a CI check, not an exception: it never
  prompts, and belongs where a catalog change triggers it.
