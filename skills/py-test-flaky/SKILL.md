  Investigate a flaky Python test and hand the fix off to
  Dev10x:work-on as a fully scoped ticket. Reproduces the
  failure, identifies the root cause, drafts the proposed
  patch in the ticket description (not in the working tree),
  files the ticket via Dev10x:ticket-create, then invokes
  Dev10x:work-on so branching, implementation, py-test gate,
  self-review, PR creation, monitor, and review-comment
  triage all run through the standard delivery pipeline.
  TRIGGER when: user reports a flaky pytest test, a test is
  marked `@pytest.mark.flaky`, or a pytest case fails
  intermittently in CI. DO NOT TRIGGER when: test failure is
  deterministic, a non-pytest framework is in use, or the
  fix is already committed.

# Fix Flaky Python Test

Investigate a flaky pytest test, scope the fix as a ticket,
and hand delivery off to `Dev10x:work-on`. This skill is a
narrow *investigator + ticket scoper* — it does NOT mutate
the working tree, create a branch, commit, or open a PR
itself. All delivery work runs through `Dev10x:work-on` so
flaky-test fixes ship with the same coverage gate, self-
review, PR monitor, and bot-comment triage as any other
ticket of comparable scope.

## Instructions

The full workflow — 5 steps covering reproduction, root-cause
analysis, draft patch, ticket creation, and hand off to
`Dev10x:work-on` — lives in [`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. `AskUserQuestion` gates documented there
are REQUIRED.
