# Dev10x:diag-friction

Diagnose and reduce permission friction. Guides the agent toward
pre-approved commands, simplifies command chains that defeat
allow-rule matching, and points to upstream issue filing when the
friction is structural (the hook itself needs updating).

> Formerly `Dev10x:skill-reinforcement`. The skill-reinforcement
> behavior (firm nudge toward the right Dev10x skill or MCP tool)
> is still core to this skill — it is one slice of the broader job
> of diagnosing why the supervisor saw a permission prompt in the
> first place. If you're looking for the old `skill-reinforcement`
> invocation, you're in the right place.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- The agent ran a CLI command that a skill already handles
- You rejected a command and want the agent to use a skill instead
- You approved a command but want to reinforce the skill habit
- You want to say "use the skills" with a structured response

## Orchestration

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Reinforce skill usage", activeForm="Reinforcing")`

Mark completed when done: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the offending command

Scan the recent conversation for the CLI command that triggered
this invocation. Look for:
- The most recent `Bash` tool call that was rejected or approved
- Any command the user flagged as wrong
- If the user provided arguments (e.g., `/Dev10x:diag-friction kubectl`),
  use that as the command identifier

Store the command string for matching.

### Step 2: Match against command-skill map

**REQUIRED — `Read` the canonical map first (GH-181 F9).** Do
NOT inline knowledge from the parent skill's SKILL.md or
recall mappings from training. The hook's YAML is authoritative
and ships updates ahead of skill docs; skipping the Read is a
documented Step 2 violation.

1. `Read(file_path="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/src/dev10x/validators/command-skill-map.yaml")`

The YAML in `skills/diag-friction/references/command-skill-map.yaml`
is a legacy copy — prefer the hook's YAML which is the single
source of truth.

Match the identified command against the `patterns` list in each
mapping entry. Use prefix matching — if the command starts with
any pattern in the list, it matches that entry.

If no match is found in the map, fall back to Step 3.

### Step 2b: Check workflow context

If a pattern match is found but the command appears to be a valid
part of the currently active skill's documented workflow, check
whether the skill says to **delegate** for this case:

- Read the active skill's SKILL.md (if identifiable from context)
- Check if the command matches a delegation point marked with
  `REQUIRED: Skill()` — a command can be valid syntax within
  a skill but still a violation if the skill mandates delegation
  to a sub-skill for that operation
- Example: `gh api --method POST .../replies` is documented in
  `gh-pr-respond` but the skill requires VALID comments to go
  through `Dev10x:gh-pr-fixup` — using the raw API is a violation

If the command is a delegation bypass, treat it as a match and
output the reinforcement pointing to the correct sub-skill.

### Step 3: Fall back to SKILLS.md

If no direct mapping exists, read `~/.claude/SKILLS.md` and scan
skill descriptions from the system-reminder context to find the
best match based on the command's purpose.

### Step 3a: Effective-file coverage (GH-1139)

**Run this BEFORE the shape audit.** The most common cause of a
prompt on a seeded machine is not a missing rule — it is a rule
that exists in the catalog and in global but not in the file the
engine actually reads (GH-1136). Diagnosing the individual command
first hides that layer, which is how a worktree stayed "constantly
stuck on basic actions" while every diag-friction run answered a
different question.

1. Resolve the effective settings file for the CWD: the worktree's
   `.claude/settings.local.json`, else the project's, else global.
2. Run the catalog-gap check and read the counts by family:

```
mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__permission_catalog_gap()
```

   Returns `total_missing`, `files_checked`, `clean`, and the
   per-family `messages`. Pass `verbose=true` to list every missing
   rule rather than the counts.

   **Fallback — Bash** (only when the MCP server is unavailable):

```bash
uvx dev10x permission catalog-gap
```

   The Bash form was primary until GH-1175, which made the *first*
   diagnostic step of the friction-diagnosis skill a source of
   permission friction: without a `Bash(uvx:*)` rule it prompts, and
   in an unattended background agent a pending prompt is neither a
   block nor a denial — so the coverage check silently never ran and
   the three-outcome routing below was unreachable. `uvx` also
   re-resolves from the network on every call even though the plugin
   is installed locally.

3. If the offending command's generalized rule (Step 3d) is in the
   catalog but absent from the effective file, say so **first**:
   the diagnosis is a **propagation gap**, not a missing rule.

**Backfill proposal gate — REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do
NOT use plain text) whenever the gap is non-empty. Options:

- **Backfill this checkout (Recommended)** — run `ensure-base` /
  `seed-worktree` for this checkout only
- **Backfill every checkout under roots** — the full maintenance run
- **Report only** — write nothing

Never write without this gate, never write a git-tracked
`settings.json`, and always write through the backup + atomic path
(`ensure_base` already does both).

**Three-outcome routing for Step 4.** Distinguish these — they have
different fixes, and conflating (a) with (b) patches per-repo while
hiding the propagation defect:

| Outcome | Condition | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| (a) propagation gap | rule in catalog, missing from effective file | backfill (gate above) |
| (b) missing default | rule absent from catalog, generally safe | propose a plugin-default addition (upstream issue, Step 3c) |
| (c) project-specific | safe only for this project | user-private synced catalog entry |

See [`references/audit-procedure.md`](references/audit-procedure.md)
§ Effective-file coverage for the resolution order and the two
sanctioned settings-read surfaces.

### Step 3b: Permission friction audit

Audit project + user settings for a simpler, pre-approved
alternative to the offending command. Most rejections happen
because chaining shifts the effective prefix away from any
allow-rule.

See [`references/audit-procedure.md`](references/audit-procedure.md)
for sources, allow-rule shapes, and the four-step audit procedure.
The audit output feeds Step 4 — surface findings even when a
skill match was also found.

### Step 3c-pre: Inline-code structured-alternatives (GH-282)

When the offending command starts with an inline-code prefix
(`python -c`, `python3 -c`, `sh -c`, `bash -c`, `perl -e`,
`ruby -e`, `node -e`, `deno eval`), the right recommendation is
almost never "extract to `~/.claude/tools/`" — it's the canonical
structured tool that already exists for the use case (jq, yq,
yamllint, actionlint, curl, etc.).

**Procedure:**

1. `Read(file_path="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/diag-friction/references/structured-alternatives.yaml")`
2. Check the offending command against `inline_code_prefixes`. If
   no prefix matches, skip this step and proceed to Step 3c.
3. Extract the inline code body (text between the quotes after the
   `-c` / `-e` flag).
4. Match the body against each entry's `detection_keywords`
   (substring match; first hit wins).
5. Surface the matched `tool` and `example` as the **primary**
   recommendation in the "Use instead" section of Step 4.
6. Fall back to the "Multi-step logic (fallback)" entry only when
   no keyword matches across all other entries.

Example match for `python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"`:
the `yaml.safe_load` keyword hits the YAML-parsing entry, so the
reinforcement names `yq` as the canonical alternative — not a
tools-directory extraction.

### Step 3c: Detect structural friction (file upstream)

When the hook itself is too aggressive, the command-skill map is
missing an entry, or no safe targeted allow-rule fits, point the
user at the upstream issue tracker so the hooks can be improved
for everyone — not patched locally over and over.

See [`references/upstream-friction.md`](references/upstream-friction.md)
for the signals that suggest structural friction and the
"Upstream issue" section template (problem statement, suggested
resolution, pre-filled `gh issue create` invocation). Do NOT
auto-file — the user approves first.

### Step 3d: Generalize the suggested rule shape (GH-597)

When the audit (Step 3b) or upstream path (Step 3c) lands on
proposing a **targeted allow-rule**, do not echo the harness's
suggested shape — it is wrong in one of three directions. Surface
the generalized shape produced by
`dev10x.skills.permission.generalize.generalize_rule_shape`:

| Failure mode | Harness suggests | Generalized shape |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| over-broad (verb-blind) | `Bash(ip route *)` | `Bash(ip route get:*)` |
| over-narrow (session arg) | `Bash(persist.sh <id> *)` | `Bash(persist.sh:*)` |
| too-literal (no wildcard) | `Bash(yarn build:x)` | `Bash(yarn build:*)` |

Apply the generalized rule in the "Pre-approved alternatives" /
"Upstream issue" sections so the rule the user accepts is reusable
and safe — never the dead-on-arrival or over-granting default.
Only Bash command rules are generalized; `mcp__*`, `WebFetch(...)`,
and `Read(...)` rules pass through unchanged.

### Step 3e: Background-dispatch pre-seed over auto-mode (GH-610)

When the friction arose inside a **background subagent** (workflow /
monitor / loop / fanout child) — or the only "fix" on offer is the
harness's "switch to auto mode" / disable-prompts nudge (the GH-310
footgun) — do NOT recommend blanket `bypassPermissions`. The correct
remedy is to fix the **dispatcher**, not to silence prompts:

1. Prepend the canonical friction-avoidance preamble to the subagent
   prompt (fetch via `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__background_preamble`).
2. Pre-seed the subagent's `allowed_tools` with the wrappers it needs
   (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `mktmp`, `push_safe`, `create_pr`, …) so
   the preferred tool surface is actually available.

Surface this as the primary recommendation whenever the offending
command came from a background dispatch path. See
`references/orchestration/background-preamble.md` and
`references/orchestration/subagent-dispatch.md` § Background Friction
Preamble.

### Step 3g: Check the recommended tool exists here (GH-1087)

A `use-tool` compensation names a tool the map assumes is present —
but the tool surface varies per session. A `find -name` rejection
routed to `Glob`, and the `Glob` call answered "No such tool available:
Glob — find files with `find` via the Bash tool instead": the map and
the harness contradicting each other, producing a friction diagnosis
that could not be executed. That is the failure mode this skill exists
to prevent.

Before recommending a `use-tool` compensation:

1. Confirm the named tool is in this session's tool surface (it appears
   in the available-tools listing, or in the deferred-tool list
   loadable via `ToolSearch`).
2. If it is absent, recommend the compensation's `fallback:` instead —
   for `find-search` that is `rg --files -g '<glob>'` (name discovery)
   or `rg -l <pattern> -g '<glob>'` (content), both covered by
   `Bash(rg:*)`.
3. Never fall back to the offending command itself. The harness's own
   "use `find` via the Bash tool" suggestion reinstates exactly the
   friction the rule removes — a pre-approved `rg` shape is available
   in every session.

State the substitution you verified, so the supervisor can see the
recommendation was checked rather than recited.

### Step 3f: Approved in-session, denied by a rule (GH-972)

When an `AskUserQuestion` gate returned "yes" and the command was
STILL refused, the two authorities disagree by design: the gate
grants intent, a `deny` rule governs the shape. Do NOT search for
an alternative spelling — the nearest ones (`git restore`,
`git stash` for a denied `git checkout --`) defeat the rail's whole
purpose. Hand the exact command to the human to run, and continue
with what the denial does not block.

See
[`references/deny-rail-vs-approval-gate.md`](references/deny-rail-vs-approval-gate.md)
for the full procedure, the substitution anti-patterns, and the
unattended-run variant.

### Step 4: Output reinforcement message

Output a firm, concise reinforcement message with seven sections:
command detected, use instead, why, how to invoke, pre-approved
alternatives (from Step 3b), upstream issue (from Step 3c when
friction is structural), related skills.

See [`references/audit-output.md`](references/audit-output.md)
for the per-section schema, MCP invocation example, and ranking
rules when multiple skills apply.

### Step 4b: Respect user rejection

**If the user explicitly rejected the command** (denied the Bash
tool call), do NOT conclude "no violation found" and resume the
rejected workflow. A user rejection overrides documentation
matching — even if the command appears valid within the skill,
the user's denial takes precedence. Instead, ask the user what
they expected if no skill match is found.

### Step 5: Reinforce the general principle

End with a brief reminder:

> Always check if a skill or MCP tool exists before reaching for
> CLI commands. Skills provide consistent behavior, proper tool
> declarations, and avoid permission friction.
>
> Prefer pre-approved commands. Keep each Bash call to one simple
> command — no `&&`/`;` chaining, no env-var prefixes, no leading
> subshells. Packing multiple steps into one call shifts the
> effective prefix and breaks allow-rule matching, which is the
> main reason supervisors see avoidable permission prompts. When
> no pre-approved form fits, propose a narrow targeted allow-rule
> rather than crafting a more elaborate command.

### Step 6: Offer follow-up action (REQUIRED when command was rejected)

If the triggering command was **rejected** by the user (denied
the Bash tool call), the reinforcement must actively offer to
retry the intended action via the recommended skill. Plain text
offers ("Want me to invoke X?") do NOT block execution and break
the structured decision flow used across Dev10x skills.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text).

1. `AskUserQuestion(questions=[{question: "Invoke <recommended-skill> now to complete the intended action?", header: "Retry", options: [{label: "Yes, invoke <skill> now (Recommended)", description: "Re-run the intended action via the correct skill"}, {label: "I'll invoke it manually later", description: "Skip for now — user will handle"}, {label: "Cancel — discard the attempted operation", description: "Do not retry"}], multiSelect: false}])`

Substitute `<recommended-skill>` with the skill identified in
Step 2 (e.g., `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor`, `Dev10x:k8s`,
`Dev10x:git`).

**Skip this gate when:**

- The user invoked the skill informationally (not after a
  rejection) and no follow-up action is implied
- No recommended skill was identified (Step 3 fallback with
  no clear match) — ask the user what they expected instead
- The triggering command was approved, not rejected — the
  intended action has already run

On approval, invoke the recommended skill immediately. On
cancellation, acknowledge and stop — do NOT resume the
rejected workflow.

## Examples

See [`references/examples.md`](references/examples.md) for five
walkthroughs:

1. **kubectl usage** — direct CLI match (`Dev10x:k8s`)
2. **direct git push** — bypassed safety skill (`Dev10x:git`)
3. **friction from chaining** — Step 3b audit surfaces a
   pre-approved alternative
4. **no match found** — fallback to SKILLS.md scan
5. **structural friction** — no safe local rule fits, file an
   upstream issue
